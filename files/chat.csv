223,Yeah I will provide details on the vision for the album project. Its main goal is to get you to play complete pieces not just falsetas and bits and pieces which is why the due date is longer. Hope we can get a variety of palos but repeat is fine like two soleas played by different people. I will post more details later on <#724786778871038082>,,,,general
224,Ok neat. I have a Picado excercise that I could play every day. And can definitely submit a piece for the album,,,,general
225,I think that's all.,,,,general
226,"The ongoing projects are
A) an flamencoGuitar discord Album. Recording due to end of the year, with or without video you have to ask <@380654265326370816>, it's his project. I'm happy to join. 

B) a picado exercise challenge where you have to play a short picado exercise every day for 182 days (half a year). <@300157987430072321> is still at it afaik

C) after some single player live streams get more in one place and have a live session. The stream later today covers that when sir AlonMeer and I display our awesome reading skills (oh boy that will be hilarious)

D) there was a transcription challenge in May that got lost and forgotten.",,,,general
227,"Oh cool, is that another collab project?<@316154052364992512>",,,,general
228,I'd like to know whether I can record some more. I think 8-12 songs should be good for the album. More is too much.,,,,general

230,Polishing my pieces for the discord album,,,,general

238,"Yeah, it will be cool if we can keep the content coming (progress videos, etc.) on a weekly basis. Just makes it feel like we're neighbors in Spain.",,,,general
239,Haha sounds like a deathbattle. No it's a respectful first live get together and we'll try to read the first few exercises. Rocking it or failing miserably.. bet it will be funny either way.,,,,general
240,I would be drunk at 10 00 AM lol,,,,general
241,Oh Haha you would all get tanked if I play. Sought reading ia not my forte but would be really fun while it's not too difficult.,,,,general

605,"But just to be clear, these are just some concerns that I have and I am okay with the current set up. I just wanted to speak up to see if anyone else had concerns like I did. Looks like it's probably a non-issue",,,,general
606,"We're a small channel but we have great conversations here. Separating our members to online, gipsy kings, the tomatito's, whatever is after tomatito's, creates an unnecessary divide and confusion. That's my strong opinion about the way roles are currently set up.",,,,general
607,"I like the technique idea by <@!316154052364992512> or ""the mecano"" (hehehe) because it's neutral.

So I took a look at different discord channels I subscribe to and most of them just don't have roles based on post count. People pay attention to these roles and If you have to ask what this role means like <@!535443748390436865> did, that means it's confusing.",,,,general

I can listen to una rosa once in a few months, right afterwards I fell into VA's Tio Arango where a dozen times a day don't feel enough. If there are personalized roles, make me ""the mecano"" ü§£

On a serious note though, <@380654265326370816> if you do have the bad experience and don't want to have this discord be on danger drowning to low level as well, maybe, if we need the roles at all, you want them to be associated with technique names I stead of artists? The alzapu√°s, the pulgars etc.

That being said I know nothing about Tomatino ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",,,,general
610,"I don‚Äôt think the names are a problem, I feel like having a rank named gipsy kings shows that we are open to all kinds of flamenco, and I‚Äôd say tomatito is just a better(more complex) guitarist than most gipsy kings.

613,How dare you not look down on those with different taste? :0,,,,general
614,I have to say I like puro flamenco over Nuevo.  But I can't imagine looking down on someone for having different taste.  Although there's some pretty bad examples of both those categories too.,,,,general
615,Maybe I'm being super overly sensitive hahaha which I absolutely am not in real life *wink*,,,,general
616,"Yeah I think we both have the same kind of humor <@!554385137702404106> and I love the naming and don't see a problem personally which is why I never brought it up.

But I thought I'd play devil's advocate to see it from another person's perspective. The mere possibility of someone (even if it's one person) taking offense makes me a little uncomfortable, but that's just me. So it would be helpful to hear other people's thoughts on this.",,,,general
617,"To be completely honest sense I didn't think of it like that , just thought of some flamenco names really. I would go as far as to say gipsy kings is my favourite type of flamenco (regardless of whether its ""pure"" flamenco or not) if its perceived like that I'll change to a new name in the near future, any suggestion?",,,,general
618,"Flamenco is a small world but I was surprised to find that there is a divide between the purists vs. the rest. That really turned me off from participating in certain flamenco communities online. I think flamenco should bring us together not segment us. Obviously we don't have that sort of attitude here so I personally don't see a problem with what names we use. It's all for fun. 

But I do see a potential problem when it comes to *new members* joining our community and seeing the ranks are organized in this way. ""Why is tomatito above gipsy kings""? ""Are they against pop/neo flamenco?""

I think it's good humor that we have ""PDL's Den"" and ""Graf Martinez's House"" in our channel list. I don't see any problem with that. But our current member group names can be taken the wrong way and new members may think we're against other styles of flamenco than flamenco puro (traditional) because of the hierarchical order. What are your thoughts on this?",,,,general

641,"I recently destroyed my right hand thumb nail and I hate it. I can't wait for it to be grown back to desired length. I just wanted to focus on alzapua too.. Acrylic nails softened my nails even further, I tried a lot of different methods. Patience and filing only, never cutting, biting, tearing, clipping etc., does the trick over the months playing a lot and only filing for my nails hard enough to be fine with their strength.",,,,general
642,"Okay, that makes sense. I've been wearing acrylics for a few months, since my nails seem to break too often. The tone difference with them isn't exactly subtle though. I'm more curious about the thumb usage. If you're doing a lot of pick-style plectrum with your thumb, can you even out the dynamics so that it can reasonably sound even?",,,,general
643,"Well in flamenco - it's almost a must that you have some sort of nail involvement. Although I have to keep my nails short for work reasons I do definitely notice a large difference in tone, and my fingerstyle does sound better and more constitent with them to be honest, but if you're playing electric (i don't have much experience on that, but i assume you don't really need long nails to play) then that's a different story",,,,general

<@!300157987430072321> If it sounds good to you, it's good! Knowing music theory helps with improvisation but I wouldn't dive into that until you get the compas down. Once you have a solid foundation, you can learn more about how you can improvise over a chord. In order to improvise well, you need to increase your musical vocabulary which can only come from a lot of experience and more importantly, in my view, a lot of listening. You have to develop your ear. That takes time and dedicated practice. Improvisation really means you are playing at the speed of thought. So your technique has to be solid or else you can't express what you want to express. It's my second year playing flamenco and I'm still doing monkey see monkey do üôÇ  I try to improvise too but that's secondary to learning the palos. Sabicas once said to be a great guitarist, you have to accompany dancers for 10 years, singers for 10 years, then you can go 10 years doing solo performance. I don't think he meant this literally, but what's true about his statement is that flamenco requires patience, communication/cooperation and lots of dedication.",,,,general

893,"That sounds reasonable. I just take more time since I switch guitars quite often, don't like to take my Conde outside and often practice at work.",,,,general
894,So I guess I will put the Annabach in two-three weeks.,,,,general

For some bizarre reason it was excruciating.

I don't know, they are very similar. I bought both to experiment with them and see wether there is a noticeable difference. La Bella are very cheap so I keep them as reserve (although Kai uses only La Bella and this is interesting, I was sure he uses ,ore expensive strings).",,,,general

945,"When you learn a compas, you Can put a song or the compas metronome",,,,general
946,I need to work out my hand.  My rasgeuos make the back of my hand sore.,,,,general
947,"I juste Come to remember something that told me someone :
For those who spend a long Times in their car, when you wants to learn a New right hand movement like a compas or rasgueados or abanicos etc you have to play on your steering wheel or your belly like if you had a guitar, it Can seems crazy but it really helped me",,,,general
948,"I find it very interesting how the mood changes when you change key. I was aware of that in other music genres but in flamenco it's very noticeable. I've practiced pituquetes tango remates with the capo on the 2nd fret. Felt good, sounded good an made it easier to play. Then I started to play solea and it's impossible for me to play solea with capo on the second fret for me. Technically it's not hard but the feeling is so very different, it just doesn't fit.",,,,general
949,I always go with normal tension.  Got some of the savarez tomatito strings coming to me.   I'll let you know how they are.  I was pretty happy with the d'addrio flamenco strings I had before though.  But I like the legato a bit more so it may not be the sound you're looking for.,,,,general
950,Ah I got ya. This is the exact string that comes with that guitar: Savarez Cristal Corum High Tension 500CJ (from their spec sheet: https://www.cordobaguitars.com/guitars/f7-paco/),,https://www.cordobaguitars.com/guitars/f7-paco/),,general
951,Ya I bought several sets of low tension strings a few weeks ago and am a bit dissatisfied with the sound. I loved how it sounded when I first got it,,,,general
952,I play a  cordoba paco f7. I just mean a brighter sound I guess snappy was the wrong adjective,,,,general
953,"In general, higher tension has louder attack and faster decay (snappy?), lower tension has more sustain and easier to bend (vibrato). You might want to consider different materials like carbon is harder than nylon which produces a brighter sound. But I'm not sure what you mean by snappier sound.",,,,general
954,What guitar do you play <@!310471796027817985> ? Maybe we can help you source the original factory installed strings.,,,,general
955,"Pro arte carbon, expensive but very clean and crisp. I used normal tension. But I prefer the Felipe Conde that came with my Conde. The wood makes a lot of the sound I guess. I don't have experience with high tension yet, I don't see why low tension would make it snappier though.. Let's ask our strings expert <@531037498629947394>  what do you think?",,,,general
956,And the default strings were normal silver strings,,,,general
957,All the the strings I've bought have been like red,,,,general
958,Flamenco,,,,general
959,Classical or flamenco strings?,,,,general
960,I've been testing out new strings lately and I'm having some difficulty finding strings that I like.  I bought mostly low tension strings so far and I havent been able to get the sound that the guitar had when I first bought it... I'm guessing they use higher tension strings for the default? Idk any ideas to get to sound snappier,,,,general
961,Hey guys. In your opinion what kind of strings give you a snappier  sound? Low or higher tension,,,,general

The beginning was from a lesson by Jeronimo de Carmen. the rest is falsetas I learnt mixed in with transitions and additions from my own in some cases. I feel like playing softer became a habit of playing at home for years trying not to disturb anyone üòÇ  My problem  regarding the position of the right hand is I always had problems with my finger nails. When they are too long it gives a thin and bad sound. When they are short the sound is too soft.

997,"Thank you for the video <@569592168411561988>
I really like your playing, was it partially improvised? It was fluent most of the time, you had the groove when not concentrating on the mistakes. I can feel when you were thinking about the mistakes, the first thing that goes away is the groove.
Personally I would have enjoyed it more with more force, it seemed soft, maybe you had to play not too loud because of your surroundings? Your right hand seems to play slightly away from the strings rather than hitting them directly. You never want to play with your thumb into your palm, try to keep a triangle between thumb, index and low e string to improve your sound. (rasgueado will have more punch, picado will have less noise and sound more clear and crispy)",,,,general

<@!436240394561519616> Usually when people teach alzapua they start with a rest stroke on one string and then the thumb down and up. But in many falsetas the alzapua starts with thumb down and then you start a new cycle (as I like to think about it) with rest stroke on one string and then thumb up and down and so on..",,,,general

1160,"<@302882878931468310>  in my opinion, you have to hear many musics from the most famous Palos, choose your favorites and learn to play his simple rhythme, if i were you, i take a palo in 12 times (the most famous are Alegrias, Bulerias and Soleas/Soleares) and another palo in 4 times like Tangos or Sevillanas. If you stay on one palo it will be anoying and you will forgive ...
It tales a lot of time to get the rhythme in your mind and play it without thinking to your right hand.
At the same time, you can learn basics right hand flamenco moves like rasgueados (there are a lot of diferents rasgueados) and the way we strike the strings with or without golpe (golpe means that you hit the wood with a nail while you hit the strings) for me it's the first lesson of flamenco",,,,general

1171,"<@302882878931468310>  welcome on the server, i'll try to explain you but my english is not perfect (i'm french / spanish).
You can say that flamenco is a family where there are severals members, each member is a palo and each palo can be played in diferents styles, for exemple ""Bulerias de Jerez"" Bulerias is the palo and Jerez is a style of Bulerias (it's a city in spain).

Each palo has a ""compas"", the compas is how we call the rhythme in flamenco. Most of the compas are in 4 or 12 times.
For exemple Bulerias and Alegrias are in 12 times where you play harder the times 3, 6, 8, 10, 12 but we always start by the time 12.
Like this :
1Ô∏è‚É£ 2Ô∏è‚É£ - 1 - 2 - 3Ô∏è‚É£ - 4 - 5 - 6Ô∏è‚É£ - 7 - 8Ô∏è‚É£ - 9 - 1Ô∏è‚É£ 0Ô∏è‚É£ - 11",,,,general

1262,"> I like Gypsy Kings too. But flamenco music isn't for everyone though. Like my family when they hear me play it, they ask me what kind of music is that. Did someone die? Why so serious. Not all of flamenco is like that of course (e.g. alegrias, bulerias) but the sound tends to be raw which some might find too emotionally draining. Personally, I like it because it's so pure and honest.
<@!380654265326370816> I agree with you, my family don't get it neither but it's ok. And that's one of the reasons why I don't like to preform in front of people. On the one hand, I'm not a virtuous player that will make them say ""WOW"" even if they don't get the music itself. On the second hand, they don't get the music and start asking ""Can you play this and this?"" so I just like doing my staff for myself and my enjoyment.",,,,general

<@305451877770985472> right but this was an important part in Paco's work and innovation. He wanted to make kind of ""fusion"" music, a mix of flamenco with modern jazz and mainstream instruments. 
Also think about it from an historical perspective, Spain was isolated from the world in the days of Franco's rule. Only in the 1960' Spain's gates were opened. At this time Paco was a teenager and still establishing his identity as a musician. And he adsorbed the new influences into his music and rode on this wave. That was one of the things that seperated his genius from people who 'just' plyed very good flamenco.",,,,general

1479,Yeah it's crazy but I believe so too.,,,,general
1480,I understand this. Maybe the market is much bigger than I believe.,,,,general
1481,"I agree with you, he does have a good presence. But he got there because of his youtube videos, free content, and all these extra things he is doing. The hourly lesson is part of that strategy, to offer more value.",,,,general
1482,"yeah of course, I just thought he already has a very good presence.",,,,general
1483,Sure that's true too but who doesn't like to save time and have passive income?,,,,general
1484,And maybe he just likes doing it,,,,general
1485,"I still think that a free lesson is still too much, I think he already has a good online presence but maybe still not enough.",,,,general
1486,"And so far from what I've seen, he's second to none.",,,,general
1487,"Even Kai does this right, he can be the Netflix for flamenco guitar. That's huge.",,,,general
1488,"Yeah it's not scalable but Kai is building a community because in the long run, his community is going to be doing the marketing for him by sharing good reviews or just mentioning his name (like what's happening in this chat). Even in a niche category as flamenco guitar, there's several online courses and subscriptions so he needs to stand out to beat out the competition. So if he can have a personal connection with you during a lesson, that's big plus. That hour he spent was not wasted because right now, it's in his best interest to get more committed students than those who sign up for a few month and leave. I can say with certainty that once he has a solid foundation, that free skype lesson with Kai is going to go away. There will be a tipping point in his business where his time is better spent on something else because he doesn't need to do that anymore. Maybe he will keep it, but it will be a teacher he hires to do the lesson instead. I'm excited for all of us because competition between content creators means better content for all of us at affordable prices.",,,,general
1489,You really get a lesson with Kai? Why does he do it? I don't think this is profitable,,,,general
1490,"I understand that but even with the sale, 15 times 12 months = 180 dollars. For 20 dollars more, you get a free one on one lesson with Kai and a book (worth $25 on amazon). Of course if you are just doing this to see if it's right for you, then the non-commitment monthly option is fine. Otherwise, yearly is still better value.",,,,general

1492,"I don't use facebook but for those that are part of Kai's facebook group, what do you guys think?",,,,general

<@300157987430072321> I agree with Ibuken. Today you may learn everything for free but you waste lots of time with filtering and comparing resources and many resources contradict each other. Moreover, as a beginner you don't even know what to look for or how to judge a resource so I believe that you should choose one recommend resource and stick with it.

1524,<@!458416050761891840>  you should come to the US to grow your nails faster then go back once they're back to ideal lengths. I need to do the opposite. File my nails and leave the country so I can practice and not spend all my time filing my nails so much.,,,,general

2019,"Nuno Bettencourt doesn't like giving notation of his work, he says you are better off figuring it out yourself and getting it close if not 100%. If you are close and it sounds good, you learned a lot more than reading something someone else transcribed.

You almost never have to figure something out for yourself, 99% of the time there are tabs or tutorials somewhere. So many players have the technical ability to execute the piece but don't have the ability to get it out by ear.

2055,"<@!310471796027817985> I have a bias towards low tension strings because I like the sound they generate and they are easier to play (to bend, pull offs, etc.).

Too much of electronic devices, too much of social groups discussing covid-19, too many news, too many fake news, too many jokes, to much tragedy.. It lead to anger and stress. We decided to just turn it all of and concentrate more on the important things.. And that's ourselves.

We talked about the strings at Xmas since some of you got new strings as well. First impression was... OK. Very light and clear in sound. I'd be very happy if I wouldn't be used to the sound of the original strings. I reached out to Felipe Conde and they said besides guitars they have their own brand of strings.

3030,"<@122533549709459459> dont want to ignore you, but the question is too specific for me.. All I can say is that there are golpeadors that you can put on and off at will, they don't leave any marks on the guitar sinsce they don't use adhesives. Your guitar has to be glazed afaik (the glossy paint... My vocabulary is failing meüò©) , it won't stick to a rough surface.",,,,general
3031,"<@458416050761891840> I would definitely check out a classical teacher rather than work with a book only. Classical teachers often know at least some things about flamenco, and the basics of guitar are more important than the basics of each Palo. Transitioning from classical to flamenco is also a lot smoother than ironing out bad habits or things that you just do plain wrong because no one told you how to.
Motivation also plays a huge role and it depends a lot on the character of your teacher and the chemistry between the two of you.
What a teacher can't do is walk the path for you, no one can practice for you, but a good teacher can show you the way. You have to walk it for yourself though.",,,,general
3032,"I'm also considering busking in my local city, but I'm banned from using any amplification. I can play steel string, but I'd rather not ditch my nails at this point to do so.

3033,"Hi guys. I just posted about this on reddit, but I'd like to add a golpeador to my classical guitar, as I'm quite close to knocking a hole in it.

3040,But I've found a great posture that keeps my back straight and comfortable enough for me to practice for a long time. I simply use several books to keep my right thigh higher (same effect as crossing your legs) and making sure my upper body is centered.,,,,general
3041,"I have issue with crossing my legs as well, my right leg tends to go to sleep and get numb pretty quick.",,,,general
3042,"Some chord changes are easier than other likes E Major to A minor (same shape, just move down a string), but others like F Major to D minor is a big jump so it can be quite challenging if your new to the guitar.",,,,general

3045,I've been working with the graf Martinez book.  I'm up through the first couple of sections but the biggest problems I'm having is with some basic left hand techniques.

3047,"If the book is working okay for you, keep going. What challenges are you facing right now that's making you look for teachers?",,,,general

3049,"<@!458416050761891840> I think classical guitar instructors can be helpful in that they will help you get started with the correct posture and general technique. Flamenco technique is different than what you would use in classical pieces, however. Another challenge would be music choices. The point of having a mentor/teacher is to provide you with (hopefully, customized) lessons that will help you reach your goals as efficiently and enjoyable as possible. The instructor can't really do that unless they have experience in all the styles of flamenco. How will they know what piece you should work on next if they are unfamiliar with flamenco?",,,,general
3050,What do you guys think about getting a classical guitar instructor if there's no flamenco teachers near me?,,,,general
3051,"My latest flamenco instruction book suggests that you play with both sides (right and left) of your nail. I figure it makes sense because after a year of prmore regularly my nails grow in a strange shape and the left side is clearly harder than the right one.

3061,"Hi. I am trying to play with nails for the first time. I grew my nails but I feel the sound is thin when I do. Also, sometimes the edges get stuck on strings and it makes playing really sloppy and uncomfortable. Can someone point me please to a good guide on filing the nail into the correct shape?",,,,general
3062,"Not dumb, sure you can. Alzapua wouldn't be efficient I think but the rasgueados are common practice among some bassists. Quintuplet tremolo would also be interesting.",,,,general
3063,can you do flamenco techniques on a bass?,,,,general
3064,heres a dumb question,,,,general
3065,Never tried voice chat but sounds fun.. But it won't be night for everyone here at the same time üòÖ,,,,general
3066,like a virtual meetup,,,,general
3067,hmm it'd be interesting if we all held a night where we'd join the voice chat and play together,,,,general
3068,"My favorites are bulerias, alegrias and granainas",,,,general
3069,"Bulerias was the thing that caught my attention, turned into soleares (in some aspects a slow Bulerias), which later switched to sevillanas since they are more strictly structured and then turned into whatever I am working on at. Alegrias is the hottest sh!t right now üòÖ ask me in a month and it will be something different. ü§£",,,,general

3073,"I wish I was in Spain and learn with the community, it'll be very interesting indeed",,,,general
3074,Those are excellent points. Bad habits are a pain to correct...,,,,general
3075,"I'd advice you to get a teacher, irl not Skype, for the basics like posture, tone and technique. For the actual music there more material online than you can cope with in 3 lifetimes.
It is a lot harder to change bad habits than to learn things afresh.",,,,general
3076,Yeah a lot of teachers will usually give you a free first lesson so you get a feel of their style etc. There's also the <#627182462606376962> channel here where you can get feedback from other learners üôÇ,,,,general
3077,Tysm! This is great advice,,,,general
3078,Not really a good example lol but maybe try a lesson or two and see how you like it!,,,,general
3079,Sabicas was self-taught but he was also considered a child prodigy,,,,general
3080,In-person lessons > skype lessons > video courses / books,,,,general
3081,"I kind of like discovering things on my own and learning it organically. But if you have the time and resources to have a teacher guide you, I think it's a no brainer.",,,,general
3082,"Now if you have a teacher, you'll learn faster because it's catered to you and you don't have to waste time researching yourself",,,,general
3083,"My opinion is a bit biased because I'm teaching myself but as long as you have a good resource to study from whether that's a book or a video, or even a friend who is a guitar player, you'll be fine",,,,general
3084,Any opinions on this? üòÖ,,,,general
3085,"I'm worried some of my foundations are flawed because I don't have a mentor to correct them, idk though",,,,general
3086,Or can a beginner be self-taught and still be proficient in flamenco?,,,,general
3087,Do you think in-person lessons are fundamental for a beginner's education?,,,,general
3088,That's awesome.  Can't wait to watch it.,,,,general

3117,Well said.,,,,general
3118,"<@316154052364992512> 
1) I disagree, I think that it only begins. Because of the social media people are always in ""comparing mode"". You understand that it is just a filter and that people only share their best moments but deep inside you still compare your lows with their highs. Picture after picture you feel more and more how your life is boring and pointless. See what Instagram became into, it's like it has taken steroids for the last two years. So many filters, so shiny, so colorful and beautiful, only to hide the real truth behind them. Girls forget to put clothes to get more followers, liked and money by advertising makeup and bikinis. Guys claim they are clean while taking steroids to sell you their supplents and training programs and so on. Everything is fake but at the same time it gives you the feeling that your life also should be so interesting while they don't and maybe will never be.

2) I agree with you. But you are judged by your possession and by your talking more than by your actions. Especially today that you must have a photo with a nice car, upload every meal from cool restaurants and so on.",,,,general
3119,"""the fact that you can be replaced every minute with a better model from Tinder, the chase after nice photos for Instagram even thogh it means to buy or do things you ca't afford to impress""

1) I think we are already getting away from this and it was worse in the last decade.
The times we all strive to become the ""best"" just like the photoshopped models and Auto tuned music seems to come to an end. Being a teacher I get in touch with 8-18 year people a lot and it seems they slowly get bored by unrealisticly perfect aspects. Slowly the mistakes get more interesting, slightly out of tune songs (e..g. Eric Claptons slide in Layla, way off the boundaries of perfect tuning, always gets my pupils fascinated) become more interesting than the sterile stuff we had to endure since the new millennium.
Same is true for what people look like. It gives hope, right?

2) about the things we buy don't need but want to have to impress... I believe, at any time, that peoples actions are way more effective than peoples possessions.",,,,general
3120,I agree,,,,general
3121,"Yeah, and if you entertain it once it gets easier and easier to entertain as time goes on.  Works for both positive and negative thoughts.",,,,general
3122,I heard this idea. You choose wether or not entertain the thoght,,,,general
3123,Monks spend a lot of time thinking about that sort of thing I guess.,,,,general
3124,"The early church fathers talk a lot about how we react to certain thoughts.  noting a difference between thinking the thought and immediately dismissing it at the door or taking the thought in and ""dancing"" with it.",,,,general
3125,but it's your responebility to decide what stays in and you express and what not,,,,general
3126,"yeah of course, you shoul aim to control you own mind but thoghts are passing by and it's ok",,,,general
3127,It's one of the reasons I like to keep my wife around.  She checks me when I start saying things that are too mean.,,,,general
3128,But they all start in the mind.,,,,general
3129,It depends on how you think them.   I know that doesn't make a lot of sense but it makes sense to me.  there's a difference between a thought that just passes through your mind and a thought that passes through your heart.,,,,general
3130,Well you're right.  We do live in a society.,,,,general
3131,I think there is a huge difference between thinking something and expressing it. We have many kinds of thoghts every second but it's our responibility to watch out what we say and what we don't,,,,general
3132,"<@!458416050761891840> right but if I live in a society the judges me and treating me by how I look, which car I have and where I work so I do feel the need to acheive those thing even if it comes at the expense of my happiness and well being",,,,general
3133,"I don't see a difference personally, to think the thought in our hearts pollutes us as much as saying it out loud.  So these people who are thinking these things but not saying them because they lack courage or as bad off as the people who are saying them.",,,,general
3134,"maybe the human nature hasn't changed but the technology gives it more ways to express it for good and bad.
For example, lots of people like to insult other people in comments on Facebook and Youtube. These people will never have the courage to express themselves this way face to face. But the technology gives the opportunity to let all this rage and anger outside without feeling like hurting somebody or doing something wrong",,,,general
3135,All the material none of the spiritual.,,,,general
3136,"yeah, it's an interesting time. We have almost everthing material. Even if you are a middle class you can survive pretty well. Yeah you work hard 8-9 hours a day, get bored etc. But you have a roof over your head and food in the fridge and can afford smartphone, computer and more toys. So we have everything but at the same time feel so empty inside",,,,general
3137,"But at the same time, people haven't changed in the last five thousand years. We just have cooler toys.",,,,general
3138,I'm so glad that I didn't have to deal with that kind of stuff.  I don't even have a Facebook page.  Your generation has the most utterly unique set of problems for all human history.,,,,general
3139,nice saying!,,,,general
3140,"Me neither don't see a problem with mariage and comitting to one person but it's pretty scarry. Especially today with the high divorce rates, the fact that you can be replaced every minute with a better model from Tinder, the chase after nice photos for Instagram even thogh it means to buy or do things you ca't afford to impress people you don't give a sh*t about and all the shitty mindset of my generation.",,,,general
3141,"""a marriage is a contest between two people to see who can sacrifice the most for the other person"".",,,,general
3142,You're not wrong.  After being married for 12 years I've learned that I don't really see a problem with arranged marriages.  Whether or not a marriage works I think has little to do with the initial attraction and more to do with whether or not the two people involved decide to make it work.,,,,general

3144,<@!458416050761891840> yeah you are right. But a relationship it's still a very a hard work and you shoul come with the right mindset,,,,general
3145,<@531037498629947394> that's only because people like to complain. They don't usually talk about the great parts.  üòã,,,,general

3150,You officially an artist in demand!,,,,general
3151,My wife has been having very ambivalent emotions about me playing guitar. On the one hand she loves that I'm playing on the other hand she hates not having my attention.   But she also likes that I've been playing the guitar instead of playing video games.   but she still gets mad at me because it seems as though as soon as I sit down practice she wants to have a conversation.,,,,general
3152,"My wife asked me whether I want to continue playing with my guitar or instead go shopping with her and our daughter..
I decided for the better... Yet it was a trap and I still had to go, now I'm watching them girls buy stuff..
I know family first, but it's hard when you consider your guitar as part of your family üòè

3155,"Hey just a suggestion for the discord.  Perhaps there could be a #guitars channel for the discussion of the instruments themselves?  Buying, selling, trading, asking about deals, prices and luthiers.   Just a thought.",,,,general
3156,I'll give it a shot.   My wife and I took a 5-Hour drive this weekend and spent most of the time working on our comp√°s.,,,,general
3157,"Since your wife is a flamenco dancer, I think you have a fantastic resource to get immersed in this art.",,,,general
3158,"One of the most helpful things I read from Kai (the guy who teaches flamencoexplained) is that ""if you want to learn flamenco (even if you don‚Äôt intend to play much for dance) and if you‚Äôre in the position to do so, there‚Äôs nothing I recommend more highly than getting to dance class and soaking in the comp√°s and experience of someone who knows way more than you do.""",,,,general
3159,What most people do is create a YouTube account and share a private video so that video isn't shared publicly. Only those who are given the link can view it. Give it a try <@458416050761891840>,,,,general
3160,"Try sharing your playing / learning progress in the <#627182462606376962> channel, it's pretty active, and you might find some feedback to be helpful to you",,,,general
3161,"Time is money though so if you find yourself being lost or stuck too often, lessons are worth it",,,,general
3162,"I've heard great things about them as well and use their free videos on YouTube all the time. Since you have a piano background, learning on your own should be easier than someone completely new to guitar.",,,,general
3163,Right on.  I figured I'd get a little classical guitar under my belt and then mov on to the flamenco once I got some good fundamentals.,,,,general
3164,"I'd consider a subscription with flamenco explained. I was there and the resources are plenty. Plus Kai Narezo gives Skype lessons, he seems to be very good on a pedagogical side. I'm not affiliated with them by any means, just my personal experience. But you can also always hit us up of you have questions. Although I'm pretty new here this community seems very helpful",,,,general
3165,If I don't have a flamenco instructor near me is it worth it to get Skype lessons?,,,,general
3166,"I think 1-2 days does not matter too much if it is too humid. I think tooo dry is worse. I'd get a de-humidifier, and use it VERY carefully",,,,general
3167,Or does it take a longer exposure time than 1 or 2 days,,,,general
3168,But I'm only worried the damage has been done?,,,,general
3169,Yes I am getting a humidifier tomorrow hopefully,,,,general
3170,40-50 is ideal. 55 is ok but 70 is a lot. Too much is not good but still better than too little.,,,,general
3171,Hi. I recently got a handmade German spruce guitar. The luthier told me to make sure I keep it at humidity levels of 60% maximum. I had a hygrometer and I kept track but today I found it to be ar 70% humidity. Is that bad and will have an effect or does it happen after being exposed to that humidity for a longer itme?,,,,general
3172,"Alright then, here goes, I'll post what I have so far, it's still a work in progress though.
I'll keep it in ""Comment only"" mode for now until there is a better solution (I don't want random trolls to do damage)",,,,general
3173,Yeah the simplest way would be just sharing the link to it.,,,,general
3174,Google spread sheet? But how to implement it here? Or just post a link in the glossary channel? I'd like to be it visible there directly,,,,general
3175,"Do you use google  <@316154052364992512>? You can share it that way if people want to add terms, they can or when you update it, we just have one file to refer to.

I love the guitar, plays, feels and sounds so good.
I'm into flamenco since summer 2018 and since the flame did not burn out I saved money to buy a flamenco guitar. When I was trying some guitars at the only shop that imports real flamenco guitars here, my wife said she does not want to spend more time looking for a fitting cheap flamenco guitar and doubled my max I wanted to spend. Thus I was able to buy the one I liked the most. Motivation grew tenfold, just today I practiced for hours and it was pure fun.",,,,general

3332,Hi all. Good stuff around here! I'm still around. Just got adopted into the church band playing acoustic every week last year so most of my weekly practice/playing time has been learning new material and r e-learning how to play a steel string. It's awesome to see all of the new interest in flamenco and quality playing on the sever! Hope you all had a great Christmas and have a good new year,,,,general
3333,"<@!283617006639513610> That's exactly my goal as well. So far, my path has been learning the Solea (they call this the mother of all palos or styles in flamenco), focusing on the rasgueado technique, and going on from there. I think the best course of action is spend some time researching who you might want to learn from, then make the decision and commit. The mods created a section called <#627182462606376962> where we just share our progress either just by writing what you're up to or sharing your progress via video. Having someone else who is open to listen to your playing is very valuable. It's like having a listener from day one of your journey to learning this art form.",,,,general

3339,"If we think of the Andalusian cadence usually am g f e or dm c b flat a the 3rd chord in the progression is often played differently because the chord is often not barred, which leads to different notes being played in the chord, for example we often play a B and an e in the f chord or a g and an e in the bflat",,,,general

3912,"<@544990592275316737> the risk of makung a hole is pretty big. I don't recommend installing a phone's screen glass for several reasons:
1. It's glass. you will break it and the glass will get deep in your finger.
2. It's not thick and strong as a real golpeadore. A golpeadore just seems like a thin piece of plastic but it isn't. It's really thick and hard to get through. The luthier who put it on my guitar really struggled to cut it and he was using a VERY sharp knife (the kind of knives that when they fall on a wood they stick into the wood).

I know that this technic is composed of three moves ( hitting one string, thumb down, and thumb up ) but when you're playing, which move is the first ?

If you change the string and the buzz is  still there, you should take the guitar for a rectification, they took all the frets and flatten that part with a plane. The fretboard moves with the weather, more when the guitar is brand new. I recomend yo buy a high tension strings and see if the diapas√≥n moves a little forward and the buzz should be gone.",,,,general

In addition, the guitar came without a golpeadore. The man in the shop told me he will order one and put it on my guitar. He told he had only golpeadore with the shape of a pickguard on acoustic guitars. Should I trust him or should I go to another luthier and give up the shop's one year warranty?

Don't buy a new classical and flamenco guitar. At first, you can buy a golpeador and ask a luthier to install it on your guitar. Also ask him to lower the action of the guitar so it will be more suitable for flamenco. Everything together should cost around 50-70$ depends on the prices in your country and the luthier level. 
Then take a year or two to explore flamenco and only then decide about getting an expensive real flamenco guitar.

When I'm serious I open the practice with some left hand exercises I took from atrafana and then some right hand exercises I took from atrafana and my teacher and then I study the new material my teacher gave me and practice the old material..

4442,i don't know much about palmas but i just did it with the music sounds good enough haha that's really cool music wouldn't have heard it if it wasn't for your introduction thank you,,,,general

4444,"1) do it just like the recording, clap on each beat, accenting the first of the three",,,,general
4445,so,,,,general
4446,[accents],,,,general
4447,"rhythm is like [1] 2 3, [4], 5, 6",,,,general
4448,"So after listening to this music, two ways you can clap:",,,,general
4449,"Just checked it out, that sounds awesome",,,,general
4450,Hisoka‚Äôs theme from hunter x hunter lol,,,,general

4458,"as there isn't any flamenco classes near where I live, I'm just relying on my own research and books",,,,general

4460,"personally, I'm just trying to get the feel of Solea down but there's so many different palos I can't imagine working on them all at once. what's been suggested to me is pick a style you like and just dive deep really understand the aire and get the feel down",,,,general

4462,"these are some of the clap patterns: base palmas, second palmas voices, contratiempos, remates",,,,general
4463,Thank you,,,,general
4464,Ahh I see,,,,general
4465,"The claps don't always land on the beat and not necessarily on accents either (e.g. In Bulerias, the claps may follow the golpes on the guitar). I'm pretty new to flamenco and this is a very complicated subject as you will need to understand the different forms or palos of flamenco.",,,,general
4466,"Hello guys, could anyone explain me the various types of flamenco and what separates them. And also how to be an accompanist with clapping. What rhythms do they clap? And do they only clap on the beats or are they allowed to improvise as they accompany?",,,,general
4467,<@380654265326370816> Thanks you very much! I'm sure I will üòÉ,,,,general
4468,"That sounds like the smart things to do! Keep us posted on your progress! If you have any immediate questions, feel free to ask. I learned a lot from this community so far and lots of experienced people here willing to help as well.",,,,general
4469,"<@380654265326370816> I'm definitaly agree with you. I tried to learn on my own and recently I have started to take skype lessons so I'm a total beginner and it's too early to decide, I will take the time and see how I progress..
haha sounds awful. I'm glad you got a flamenco guitar üòÉ",,,,general
4470,what's up <@376569234890948609>,,,,general
4471,i did rasgueos on an acoustic hahaha... it will definitely be easier for your nylon guitar,,,,general
4472,"I personally bought a flamenco book and learned on my acoustic guitar, it wasn't comfortable but i figured out flamenco wasn't just a temporary thing, it's something i wanted to invest a lot of time in. that's when i decided to get a flamenco guitar. since you have a nylon guitar, you could probably learn even more before you decide.",,,,general
4473,That's great <@531037498629947394>,,,,general
4474,hey <@376569234890948609>,,,,general
4475,"<@380654265326370816>  Thanks for the in depth answer!
I agree it's an expensive guitar but I limited to the variety available in my country. Furthermore, I have compared prices in my country with Spain's and on average there is a difference of 276$. Except this particular guirar, in this case the difference is ""only"" 166$. Still a lot of money but 100$ cheaper... I'm not in a rush, I have my classical guitar for now but I have started to think about this topic.
Thanks again!",,,,general
4476,Hello!,,,,general
4477,"TL;DR, guitar looks and sounds good to me. It's a little bit expensive but I wouldn't worry too much if this guitar feels good to you. Good luck with the search!",,,,general
4478,"But like buying a car, I like to test drive a few other guitars nearby. Come in a different day and see if your opinions have changed.",,,,general
4479,"If it feels right and sounds good to your ears, go get it and get practicing üòÉ",,,,general
4480,"For a beginner's guitar, it's expensive (US shops are selling it for $800)  but you do get nicer tuners, better neck. Is it worth 2x what you might get from a entry level cordoba or yamaha (~$400)? I doubt it will be 2x better but this guitar has a distinct look, it's not made in China and I would argue that if it looks and feels great to you, then why not. Time is money and the longer you research and don't have a guitar to practice is also costing money too. I'd say go to an actual shop, do check it out, ask the salesman to play a little bit (that is if they know flamenco). If not, you can just try playing a familiar tune or just run some scales/chords and get a feel of it.",,,,general
4481,"it does have laminated sides but that's not a big issue, i have a laminated side acoustic guitar that I absolutely adore. Most people agree that the top wood is the most important component.",,,,general
4482,"<@531037498629947394> I love the way it looks and the fact that it has an ebony fingerboard. Most student models don't have it but playability is important and if you can up your spend to get a guitar that has one, it should serve you well. It's made in Spain too. I gave it a listen and it sounds great.

Guitars made in Spain: the traditional methods of renowned Spanish luthiers are used to create classical guitars, flamenco guitars and acoustic guitars. The best quality woods and the most refined craftsmanship are&nbsp;the benchmark of Spanish guitars. &nbsp;You will find student and beginner models, concert guitars, electrified models with or without cutaway, and even MIDI classical and flamenco guitars in our store. You will also be able to acquire&nbsp;special-sized guitars adapted to your hands. All with a common denominator: Handmade in Spain.
Buy the best flamenco guitars from Spain, home&nbsp;of the flamenco Guitar. Manufacturers such as&nbsp;Alhambra Guitars, Raimundo Guitars, Ramirez guitars, Admira Guitars, Camps Guitars or Prudencio Saez Guitars are famed for being&nbsp;the makers of the best flamenco guitars in the world. At Guitar from Spain you can acquire&nbsp;a flamenco guitar to&nbsp;the highest standards of quality and&nbsp;at the most reasonable&nbsp;price. Whether you play flamenco or any other music style, a flamenco guitar is&nbsp;a comfortable guitar to play, by virtue of&nbsp;its lower action and great playability.
The &quot;flamenca blanca&quot; is the traditional flamenco guitar, handcrafted using&nbsp;the same construction methods as&nbsp;the pioneers&nbsp;of the flamenco guitar. Their&nbsp;legacy has remained intact through generations of Spanish guitar makers. Quality woods such as cypress, spruce or sycamore are used in the manufacture of our guitars.&nbsp;They are punchy and have a short attack with a distinctive tone. They are also lighter than classical guitars.
Electro-acoustic flamenco guitars made in Spain, equipped with the best electronics and pickups from Fishman,&nbsp;LR Baggs,&nbsp;Schertler or RMC. A marriage of tradition and innovation to attain&nbsp;the best performance guitars for the stage and the studio. Among our major suppliers we number&nbsp;Alhambra Guitars, Ramirez Guitars, Raimundo Guitars, Admira Guitars, Camps Guitars and&nbsp;Prudencio Saez Guitars. These manufacturers have been making handcrafted guitars for decades,&nbsp;to&nbsp;the highest quality standards.
The &quot;flamenca negra&quot;&nbsp;guitar differs from the &quot;flamenca blanca&quot;&nbsp;in&nbsp;the kind of woods used to make the body. The back and sides of a flamenca negra are made of denser woods, such as rosewood. The purpose&nbsp;is to achieve a greater sound projection and a higher volume. These guitars are ideal for concert flamenco players, and anyone who wants to enjoy a versatile guitar with lower string action.&nbsp;
The artisan series of flamenco guitars represent the top of the line of each manufacturer. They are wholly&nbsp;handmade guitars using the traditional methods of Spanish guitar makers. Each piece is unique and has its own feel and particular sound. Only the finest&nbsp;materials are used to make these&nbsp;instruments, and only master luthiers with the greatest&nbsp;experience are involved in&nbsp;the manufacturing process. These guitars&nbsp;are a great investment for guitar lovers and collectors. Among our major suppliers we work with&nbsp;Alhambra Guitars, Ramirez Guitars, Raimundo Guitars, Camps Guitars and&nbsp;Prudencio Saez Guitars.
Cutaway flamenco guitars represent the introduction of current&nbsp;guitar-playing techniques to the classical and flamenco guitar. These guitars maintain&nbsp;the consistent&nbsp;quality and craftsmanship of traditional Spanish guitars, coupled with a cutaway body, &nbsp;to more easily&nbsp;access &nbsp;the last frets on the fingerboard. Some of them come with electronics and / or with narrow bodies. Among our major suppliers we number&nbsp;Alhambra Guitars, Ramirez Guitars, Raimundo Guitars, Admira Guitars, Camps Guitars and&nbsp;Prudencio Saez Guitars. They have been making handcrafted guitars for decades, and offer the highest standards of quality.
Buy first-rate&nbsp;classical guitars manufactured in Spain by the most prestigious Spanish guitar makers:&nbsp;Alhambra Guitars, Raimundo Guitars, Ramirez Guitars, Admira Guitars, Camps Guitars or Prudencio Saez Guitars. In our range of classical guitars you will find student guitars, concert guitars and professional luthier models. Spanish guitars are made with the traditional Spanish heel, which guarantees a perfect union between the&nbsp;neck of the guitar and&nbsp;the body, increasing its volume potential and sustain.
Classical guitars, handmade in Spain using traditional methods and an excellent selection of solid woods and other high-quality materials are ideal for every advanced guitarist. Excellent playability and a strong, beautiful tone with a rich variety of nuances are only a few of&nbsp;the superior qualities you will find&nbsp;in&nbsp;our Concert Line guitars. Our major suppliers are the following: Alhambra Guitars, Ramirez Guitars, Raimundo Guitars, Admira Guitars, Camps Guitars and&nbsp;Prudencio Saez Guitars.
These Classical guitars have been specially designed to achieve a comfortable action of the instrument. Student progress is clearly determined by this factor. Spanish classical guitars fulfill the requisites&nbsp;of both students and teachers for a&nbsp;truly balanced instrument both in sound and action. If your budget allows you to, avoid imitations, as the student will progress more smoothly&nbsp;with a quality guitar. Any of these models will afford you the guarantee of a quality guitar with no tuning problems, as well as&nbsp;encourage&nbsp;you to quickly advance&nbsp;in&nbsp;your&nbsp;guitar playing technique.
The artisan series of Classical Guitars represents the top of the line of each manufacturer and each of these instruments is&nbsp;entirely&nbsp;handmade. Traditional methods of spanish guitar making are employed in the construction process, meaning each piece is unique and has its own feel and particular sound. Using only the finest&nbsp;materials, these instruments are produced by&nbsp;the master luthiers of each guitar house, with the&nbsp;longest experience in their art.&nbsp;They represent a great investment for guitar lovers and collectors. Among our major suppliers we count&nbsp;Alhambra Guitars, Ramirez Guitars, Raimundo Guitars, Camps Guitars and Prudencio Saez Guitars.
Electro-Acoustic guitars with nylon strings or Electro-Classical guitars made in Spain with first-rate&nbsp;preamps and pickups from Fishman, Roland, RMC, Shadow and other premium acoustic pickup manufactures. Tradition meets innovation to achieve&nbsp;the finest&nbsp;performing guitars for stage and studio. Among our major suppliers we encompass&nbsp;Alhambra Guitars, Ramirez Guitars, Raimundo Guitars, Admira Guitars, Camps Guitars and Prudencio Saez Guitars
The cutaway classical guitar models&nbsp;embody&nbsp;the consolidation&nbsp;of the most up-to-date&nbsp;guitar playing techniques to the classical and flamenco guitar. These guitars combine&nbsp;the quality and craftsmanship of traditional Spanish guitars with a cutaway body to allow easier&nbsp;access to the upper&nbsp;frets on the fingerboard. Some of them come with electronics on board and/or with narrow bodies. Among our major suppliers we include&nbsp;Alhambra Guitars, Ramirez Guitars, Raimundo Guitars, Admira Guitars, Camps Guitars and&nbsp;Prudencio Saez Guitars.
Here you can find premium&nbsp;steel-stringed acoustic guitars, handcrafted&nbsp;using the&nbsp;techniques and craftsmanship of primo&nbsp;Spanish luthiers. With unique features such as&nbsp;the &quot;Spanish Heel&quot; these guitars have been crafted using&nbsp;only the finest&nbsp;woods. They are available&nbsp;in different sizes and formats: jumbo guitars, dreadnought guitars or auditorium guitars; full-body or cutaway body. For the same price as a mass produced guitar made in Asia, you will be able to pick up&nbsp;unique acoustic guitar made in Spain with passion, patience and love.
Spanish classical guitars and flamenco guitars with MIDI system on board from prestigious&nbsp;Spanish guitar makers Ramirez guitars, Raimundo guitars and&nbsp;Camps guitars. The MIDI device works rather like&nbsp;a language; a protocol that uses a digital signal previously coded by controllers. This enables any MIDI instrument to communicate with other machines including&nbsp; PC and MAC computers, synthesizers, sound modules, score editors, and other software.
Thin body classical and flamenco guitars. These guitars have a standard 4/4 body&nbsp;but the depth of the guitar is narrower for extra comfort and lightness. Despite their narrower bodies, thin bodied guitars&nbsp;maintain&nbsp;an excellent sound and volume when not amplified. They are also less sensitive to unwanted feedback than full bodied electro-classical guitars.
The Crossover guitar&nbsp;has a&nbsp;classical guitar body&nbsp;with&nbsp;cutaway,&nbsp;and a narrower neck with some radius in the fingerboard. They normally come electrified with&nbsp;piezo electric pickup&nbsp;and Preamp, but you can buy them with&nbsp;no&nbsp;electrification system. The targeted guitarist for the&nbsp;Crossover guitar&nbsp;is the&nbsp;electric guitar player&nbsp;and the&nbsp;acoustic guitar player&nbsp;that finds the neck of the classical or&nbsp;flamenco guitars&nbsp;too wide or&nbsp;too flat for their playing techniques.&nbsp;
The Baritone guitar is an innovative and niche instrument that is a relatively new addition to&nbsp;the guitar&nbsp;family. Considering the standard guitar as a Tenor instrument, opposed to the Requinto or Soprano guitar, undoubtedly this new instrument covers the lower range existing between the Bass and the standard guitar, so its sound falls perfectly as a Baritone guitar.
The early&nbsp;romantic guitar&nbsp;is the guitar of the Classical and Romantic period of music, showing remarkable consistency in the instrument from 1790 to 1830.&nbsp;A small bodied classic, with a huge voice built deeper than the traditional classic guitar. Beautiful, elegant and thoroughly classic, the&nbsp;Classic Romantic guitar is a dream for the passionate and a virtual necessity for the discerning musician
Special&nbsp;size guitars made with the same specifications and materials of standard size guitars but adapted to smaller scale length. Smaller sized acoustic guitars ideal for the younger ones&nbsp;or for&nbsp;guitarists with small hands. Have a look at our catalog and choose your special size guitar.

4487,"the way i'm fingering the chord is: middle finger plays the 6th string on the 3rd fret, pinky plays the 3rd string on the 4th fret, ring finger plays the 2nd string on the 3rd fret, and index plays the 1st string on the 2nd fret",,,,general
4488,Gmaj7 (GXDBDF#) I'm playing it as 3X0432 so the middle finger doesn't have to be lifted so much but i'm not sure where you are having an issue,,,,general

What guitar do you own? How long do you own it and would you recommend it?
I have a simple classical guitar of Manuel Albenize which I took to a luthier to lower the action an put a golpeadore so it will resemble a flamenco guitar. But I'm looking forward to buy a real flamenco guitar in the future as I progress.

4541,He's playing on the si and sol string I believe.  Between the 1st and 5th fret.  You should be able to pick it up by ear 1 note at a time if you pause and pluck to find it - that's the best way to start training yourself to pick things out imo.,,,,general

4551,"I mainly use Mart√≠n‚Äôs latest book ‚Äú Essential Flamenco Guitar ‚Äù Volume 1. It comes with a DVD which is extremely valuable in my opinion. I also  supplement it with his other famous book, ""El Arte Flamenco de la Guitarra."" Both books require a lot of dedication but the first one goes more in-depth. If you are new to guitar, I'd recommend the first one. The second one is great if you have the basics down but you will be learning everything from text as there is no DVD.",,,,general

4646,well im going to go make my self some tea to have a cup nearby to practice these moves on,,,,general
4647,then you can add as many steps as you want but more of 5 it's useless,,,,general
4648,ahhhh i get it,,,,general
4649,and you repeat this,,,,general
4650,"but you can do :
thumb up  ->  others fingers down  ->  thumb down  -> **thumb up again**
so now there are 4 moves",,,,general
4651,you repeat this,,,,general
4652,"a normal rasgueado is :
thumb up  ->  others fingers down  ->  thumb down",,,,general
4653,<@436240394561519616> i'm not sure what you mean by three moves and then add the first move,,,,general
4654,so you would just rest your thumb on one part of the cup?,,,,general
4655,Yeah,,,,general
4656,that's genius because you don't necesarily need to be with ur guitar to practice huh,,,,general
4657,I picked them up pretty fast that way,,,,general
4658,it helps to have a regular move,,,,general
4659,When I started I practiced away from the guitar alot on cups and glasses,,,,general
4660,do you understand what i say ?,,,,general
4661,"one thing that really helped me for rasgueados is of cours to start really slow, but when you start to have the three moves, you add the first move, so you do a rasgueado in 4 times, then you add another time etc ...",,,,general
4662,the things we do to become flamenco guitarristas XD,,,,general
4663,the only problem is i never really flicked a piece of paper so i actually got me some paper from my printer and started flicking it around,,,,general
4664,that's how much force you should use,,,,general
4665,"he said, imagine flicking a piece of paper with each finger",,,,general

4668,yeah it's a great tool,,,,general
4669,There's virtually no one to talk to regarding flamenco shit lol,,,,general
4670,I like that someone set this up,,,,general
4671,"it's when you corrects all the little imperfections that it starts to sound good, but it's the hardest",,,,general
4672,yes it's hard to be very fast doing it and still being precise to don't strike too hard,,,,general
4673,Problem with my rasgueados is I'm striking too hard,,,,general
4674,Yeah,,,,general
4675,I've done a lot of thumb falsetas so I'm pretty decent,,,,general

4682,"can you do ""azlapua"" move ?",,,,general
4683,I'll give it a tey,,,,general
4684,You're probably right,,,,general
4685,"yes i understand, but i think that when your move become automatic (easy to say ...), it can help to increase your regularity",,,,general
4686,That's a really stupid thing I'm saying considering what flamenco is but I'm easily distracted lol,,,,general
4687,I guess my internal counting and which strings to hit when it seems like the clapping would make it impossible,,,,general
4688,personaly it helped me for tanguillos,,,,general

4787,"so apparently is is just a track mislabeled, which was fairly common at that time, especially if you look at the names of pieces aired on special performance on some of the footage from old recordings on air, you'll find they were often all over the place.  Either it was rampant mistakes, deliberate misdirection of the studios wanting people to think he was playing something he wasn't, or maybe more likely, Paco had been asked/expected to play one certain piece and  he showed up and decided he felt moved to play something different.",,,,general

My second is Spanish and I'll say your English is way better than my spanish!  THanks for the kind words on playing.  I'm out of practice and not really much of a guitar player even when I'm in, but I am okay at playing a few palos.",,,,general

If yes, i can see you're so much better than me, i started two months ago, as i said, i'm a beginner and I can say mistakes, but from what i saw and what I tried, i think that alegria is one of the hardest palo to learn.
For my part I mainly learn about rumba, and I would like to answer you that I know that we (me and my brother) call ""a comp√†s"" the way, the order as we hit the strings but we know that it's not the good word to say it, does it exists a word to say that ?
I know that it's the wrong word because we can play rumba comp√†s (in the true sense) in at least three diferents ways.",,,,general

Alegr√≠as example with and without amii rasgueos
",https://youtu.be/ICJMEuHhurw,,general
4800,"Just to give an example of what I mean above here below is a very quick Allegrias comp√°s... Apologies on the quality of sound and playing. 12 beats comp√°s, C to G on beat 3 and back to C on 10  G on next 10 etc. is the general progression here... 1st 30 seconds is typical with amii 16th note rasgueos, the last 30 seconds is the same idea played only with up and down strums with i, which imo, is the correct way to approach learning a new palo - by pursuing the basic rhythmic and harmonic motion,then working rasgueos variations into that as a later step.",,,,general
4801,"Andr√©, i just wanted to mention that what you say about having to hits strings in a precise order or what have you for a given comp√°s is not technically correct (though maybe I am just misunderstanding you). But in any case the important is just to know the comp√°s, and how the rhythm and harmony fits into that. There are instructors On you tube like Ruben Diaz that promote specific strum patterns for a specific comp√°s but it's nonsense as what they are teaching is Just one strum pattern of many ways to communicate comp√°s. In the case of r Diaz if you ever run across him, it's usually a very overly complex strum pattern that's not worth learning if you're a beginner.",,,,general

4803,I say it but you could laugh a lot if you saw my right hand,,,,general
4804,Me too lol,,,,general
4805,"Yeah I just cut my nails a bit today, so much easier to play, though I'm pretty sure I didn't cut it right, just going by trial and error here",,,,general
4806,And try to keep good nails is a good advice too,,,,general
4807,Now i prefer to learn really slowly even if i don't hear any song during many hours,,,,general
4808,Yes i have two compas that i do very bad because i would to go fast and i took a bad move that i want to forget,,,,general
4809,It's hard because I'm so impatient lol but yes must practice slowly at correct even tempo,,,,general

4814,Especially the unique thumb technique of flamenco guitar it was hard to understand until I saw many videos of professional players and tried imitating it,,,,general
4815,"Sometimes i do the same move during two hours and it sounds very bad, but the tomorrow, it starts to sound good",,,,general
4816,Yeah watching how their right hand works on Youtube has been invaluable,,,,general

4823,I have a much better understanding with your examples,,,,general
4824,Thank you Andre!,,,,general
4825,Two cycles = 24 times is better i think,,,,general
4826,"You can't say ""two compas"" = 24 beats",,,,general
4827,"Yes, you will repeat cycles of twelve times, but it doesn't means that you will hit strings twelve times per cycle. There are often silence times in the cycles",,,,general
4828,"So in the case of Solea, one compas = 12 beats. Two compas = 24 beats?",,,,general
4829,"Yes, that's it, but there are several way to play solea, for my part i say that ""there are several solea's compas"" but i don't know if it's true ...
But me and my brother understand it like this",,,,general
4830,"On thi video, you can learn one of the diferents moves you can do follow the rythm",,,,general
4831,"Oh I see so for a Solea, the compas is describing the twelve beats and how they are emphasized (3, 6, 8, 10, 12 are accented)",,,,general
4832,"When you learn a compas to play it on your guitar, you have to learne which moves your right hand will do to hit the strings in a precise order",,,,general
4833,"All what i'll say you, i found it alone so maybe there are erors, but every style of flamenco has a compas, the compas is the rythmic cycle that repeats himself.
You can follow the compas by claping your hands, dancing or playing guitar",,,,general
4834,So many new terms like I'm studying for an exam hahah,,,,general
4835,And rumba is a type of compas?,,,,general
4836,I'm still confused what a compas is. Is it just a rhythmic pattern ?,,,,general

4841,What are you working on?,,,,general
4842,Thanks <@436240394561519616> . That's totally valid idea. Just playing Am -> D -> Am -> E -> repeat on a flamenco guitar is a blast.,,,,general
4843,"It's a beginer opinion, so maybe it's not a good idea",,,,general
4844,"When you're beginer in flamenco like me, i think the first thing to do is to find a style or ""palo"" that you like and learn his ""comp√†s"" and practice it on your guitar during many hours until your right hand move become automatic et then you can add chords and learn songs",,,,general
4845,"I come from acoustic guitar so having recently acquired a flamenco guitar, I've been fascinated with the lightness of the guitar. When I go back to my acoustic guitar, it feels so heavy...

But my problem is that nobody listen flamenco around me so i think i'll go in a flamenco bar in my city to make new relationship because someone told me that flamenco is not writable and that it's better to know someone who can explain me basics",,,,general
4855,"My advice is always to start with listening a lot. If you go in the wiki of r/flamenco there is a link to some good resources, rito y geographia probably being the absolute best in YouTube along with the nuestro flamenco podcast. Hearing it a lot is the best way to internalize comp√°s. It takes a while before you can start to pick it out.",,,,general

What can you say to someone who want to learn basics of flamenco ?
Any advices ?",,,,general
4857,"I feel like I've seen it before on a pic or ""new gear"" post on some forum, but I don't recall unning into it irl. Steel strings have the ""through body"" design tho",,,,general

Did you ever see this kind of string mount ?",,,,general
4859,You could also check with whoever made the guitar and see if they think it's okay to use the bridge normally.,,,,general
4860,You can just snip the balls off and try again and see,,,,general
4861,Yeah possibly 1) the balls are rattling against the soundboard or 2) knot is slowly slipping.  If 2 they will be going out of tune as well.,,,,general
4862,So maybe you're right and it's the strings ending inside the case that vibrate against the table from inside,,,,general
4863,There is a metallic sound especially on the three biggest strings,,,,general
4864,There was little red balls at the end of strings but the holes were too large and strings passed entierly through the hole so i tied knots,,,,general
4865,Oh... So were they ball end strings or did you have to tie a knot?  If tied it might be some extra string rattling. What kind of strange sound are you hearing? Is it staying in tune?,,,,general

The gypsy kings have plenty of rumba.  Jesse Cook is pretty popular too.  Strunz and Farah - all of these are guys that have taken the flamenco rumba and made it it's own genre.

One bit of advice I would give people new to flamenco is just resisting the temptation to move to full pieces without having the techniques needed to play them. I‚Äôve wasted a lot of years by fooling around with falsetas that I didn‚Äôt have the techniques for and just moving to the next falsetas hoping I could play it then years go by and your technique is still garbage and you haven‚Äôt really even learned the pieces because you can‚Äôt pull off the techniques needed to play them.,,,,general

Apoyando / Tirando / Picado. Can we elaborate on that a little further, everything explained here can used in the spreadsheet.

I know apoyando are rest strokes, tirando are free strokes and used ""picado"" as kinda fancy word to play apoyando with more pressure towards the body of the guitar.

Like with any disease, the more you google about it the more different explanations/views you get.

According to google
1) apoyando and picado are the same
2) apoyando and picado are different in tone
3) apoyando and picado are different in hand posture
4) apoyando and picado are different in hand posture on a minimal level so you can't tell the difference due to the different hands everyone has

It's mostly technique and although you will need to develop some finger strength, it's not like doing a bench press with 2 plates. A five year old that has practiced this technique can do it without issue. The barring comes from the side of your index finger. The thumb shouldn't be doing any extra work. When you play E major chord, how hard is your thumb working? Not much right? It's just there to hold the guitar in place. When you play bar chords, you are using the index finger with the weight of your entire hand to press it against the fingerboard. The index finger is just the contact point. The pressure you apply comes from your elbow and forearm. Do not use your finger joints or you will tire really quickly and potentially injure yourself. It's kind of hard to explain with words but do try it out and ask questions please. At any point you feel ""off"" or something is hurting, stop until that pain goes away. If it keeps coming back, your technique is at fault here.

When you play E major chord, how hard is your thumb working? Not much right? It's just there to hold the guitar in place. When you play bar chords, you are using the index finger with the weight of your entire hand to press it against the fingerboard. The index finger is just the contact point. The pressure you apply comes from your elbow and forearm. Do not use your finger joints or you will tire really quickly and potentially injure yourself. It's kind of hard to explain with words but do try it out and ask questions please. At any point you feel ""off"" or something is hurting, stop until that pain goes away. If it keeps coming back, your technique is at fault here.",,,,techniques

5216,"<@!531037498629947394> A chart of Triads, the columns are for the quality of the chord(Maj,Min,Dim) which I assume you know, each row is a different Triplet of string, then the rows gets subdivided for different voicing(or inversion) of the triad(R = Root, 3 = third, 5 = fifth) t
So its quite simple to navigate it, you just take the shape that is given to you and play it! you can have some fun trying each of the inversions that are listed here, see how the chord is the same but gets nuanced differently if the bass note is the fifth, or the third etc... 
It can be quite useful to use in your solos/riff if you have them in mind, they're also heavily used in funk/soul(not so much in flamenco maybe ?). Triads are just a great tool in many ways. But i'm only starting to go into that rabbit hole..!",,,,techniques

Getting alzapua on a classical guitar is very difficult and uncomfortable since its high action.

But <@!380654265326370816> I don't completely  agree with your approach to practicing. I think that you always sould do exercises, even if you have already learnt the technique. Try to choose one exercise to the left hand, one to picado, one to arrpegio, one to tremolo and one to pulgar. Take the most simple exercises and play them slowly with metronome. When it becomes too easy add 5-10 bpm. Do it for a month or two and tell us if you notice any difference.

""music should be judged and that is 100% by how it sounds"" - I get your point, this is the end product so player should be judged based on how he sounds. But with flaws in his technique I think he leaves lots of speed, accuracy and tone on the table. Take the same player, fix his technique and I can guarantee he will sound better. 

""there is no such thing as perfect technique"" - I agree with you but I think there are universal laws like the angle of attack in picado and free strokes and the right angle of the thumb in pulgar and alzapua, equal tremolo and arpegio, left hand position and so on. After the player masters these laws he is allowed to modificate his technique for his own comfort and optimization but without violating these laws. 

""if I keep questioning my own style and try to just like Tomatito in the way he does XYZ, I lose confidence in what I'm doing and become self-conscious which can be distracting"" - like I said above, you are right, you shouldn't try to copy exactly anyone because everyone develops his unique technique but while being accountable to the basics. And who do you should copy? Grisha, Paco, Tomattito, the author of the book or your teacher? In the end of the day you take something from everyone and adjust it to your own needs without violating the basics. 

""If I can make music I'm proud of sharing, that's good enough for me"" - I agree with you. but again, Improve your technique and you will create music you will be even more proud of. 

"" try not to be too obsessed with doing everything right"" - I agree. Sometimes it's even worse than not giving a f* about tecnique because when you become obsessed you are never fulfilled and you spent too much time on moving you finger 1 cm to the right instead of creating music.",,,,techniques

But, if I keep questioning my own style and try to just like Tomatito in the way he does XYZ, I lose confidence in what I'm doing and become self-conscious which can be distracting.

5339,So that's roughly what I do but I'm not too obsessed over it to be honest,,,,techniques

5342,"<@280249518812037120> I think that different people prefer different shape of nails. it's probably affected by anatomy, hand position etc..
I have seen videos of very good flamenco player who claimed that his way of shaping nails is the most effective and scientifically calculated but as I tried it my fingernails started to catch on the strings and started to break more often until I got tired of this and cut them.

I think most areas of life are like that, you are always working hard and dealing with difficulties hoping that someday in the far future you will have couple of momemnts to enjoy your achievment. And then you move on to pursue the next one.
So what's the point of all of this? But in the end, almost everything you do in life enrich you as a person and give you the oppprtunity to investigate and enjoy new discoverings. The same with guitar :)",,,,music

So there appear to be much more abouth flamenco than I thought,  including some lessons by Antonio Rey and other flamenco guitarists.
And yes, I remember that someone here gave us positive feedback about Kai's book. If I'm not mistaken you get it for free when you buy the yearly subscription to Kai's site.",,,,music
5887,"<@531037498629947394> That's great to know, I didn't know about their classical guitar courses. I have yet to try Kai's lessons, but his free ones are pretty good and worth a watch. Will have to buy his book at some point. I think someone mentioned they bought it and shared a positive review here a while back.",,,,music
5888,"<@380654265326370816> yeah, Rey said in the Interview that there are some flamenco lessons taught by him. 
Elite guitarist seems to be a great site but most of the instructors there are classical guitarists who teach classical pieces. It's like Kai's site flamenco explained but mostly for classical guitarists.
<@544990592275316737> yes, really inspiring. I also like he said ""I am just an average guy with a dream"". So humble!",,,,music

5901,Fantastic playing by a young female flamenco guitarist!,,,,music
5902,"<@328128542850285578> yeah reason for thinking it was ‚Äúnon traditional‚Äù is the singing/the construction of the vocal melody as the palmas and guitar, as you said were basically a standard rumba but the way it is sung and the structure of the vocal sounded more poppy to me, and ironically a lot of ‚Äútraditonal‚Äù flamenco songs are far more popular than ‚Äúpop‚Äù flamenco songs",,,,music

5904,<@544990592275316737> sorry if I sounded rude didn't mean to be.,,,,music
5905,"Maybe the real question here is whether there is any flamenco anywhere that is popular enough to be considered ""pop""  üòÅ",,,,music
5906,"<@544990592275316737> the song you linked  is a rumba - I don't know that you can get folks to agree on whether or not rumba as a palo is even to be considered ""traditional"" and I don't think there's a clear way to say that really for any palo there is a point of traditional vs. non-traditional.   It's just a matter of whether the compas fits in the palo and then, for many palos, you can go a step further with whether it uses established melodies and/or established letras - but even then everyone puts their own spin on the melodies and lyrics.",,,,music
5907,"Idk I really like the song, I‚Äôm just curious as to how traditional it is I guess",,,,music
5908,I'm not sure why the flamenco community is so hung up on what's real vs what isn't,,,,music

6018,Rewatching I realize my alzapua tip was explained a little confusing and played wrong.. Here's what I meant if it wasn't clear.,,,,learning
6019,"Glad you like it. ""Learning"" initially was meant as the ""show your progress"" channel.",,,,learning
6020,"We use the same abanico, I do anchor for alzapua. I actually like anchoring for certain thumb passages. Like in the alegrias falseta and for getting the nice tone for the slow drag thumb strokes",,,,learning
6021,"Hey that's a great video! I'll make one tomorrow so you can see where I'm at with those things, and then the progress video later",,,,learning

6027,Oh cool! I'm actually working on a variation of that rn. Just got it yesterday,,,,learning
6028,I worked on learning the solea escobilla from the anatomy of a compass video on flamenco explained.,,,,learning
6029,"Oh nice, what did you do?",,,,learning
6030,Probably not going to get much in today.  But I have the day off yesterday and managed to get a lot in.,,,,learning
6031,Good morning everyone. What's your practice look like today?,,,,learning
6032,"Cool, thanks :)  I also will accent odd numbers. Counting 3s to any of those seems to help my clarity",,,,learning
6033,Plus while practicing that slowly is a great opportunity to work in practicing it in time rather than just shooting it. Practicing quintuplets at a slow pace is a good exercise.,,,,learning
6034,"Basically sixteenth and quintuplets, the concept of loading before i shoots down stays the same",,,,learning
6035,I Definately practice that one. Also juan likes q a m i i,,,,learning

6038,"Hahaha yeah it's harder than it looks because it feels very foreign at first but that's really all you need to do. Once muscle memory kicks in, it feels like a super basic move. It does take work to get it sounding even because the pinky is weakkk. Do some pinky pull ups jk",,,,learning
6039,"Thanks for the video, it seems like it should be more complicated than that lol",,,,learning
6040,Exactly. It's one quick motion instead of several motions. You just don't have the time to do that when you're going fast,,,,learning
6041,"Ok that makes sense <@380654265326370816> . So, load all the right on index instead of trying to do it gradually",,,,learning

6051,"Do it slowly and count 1, 2, 3, 4 each time your fingers strike the string",,,,learning
6052,Actually not that bad. Try this,,,,learning
6053,Hard to load that one,,,,learning
6054,"Ah I see. I'll try loading it that way. Btw, juan martin plays his all down. Q a m i all down repeatedly",,,,learning
6055,"<@!738765340909240470> I can't answer alzapua or abanico (not proficient enough on these yet) but the trick to playing continuing rasgueado is to relax your hand like your waving at someone, and to prepare your pinky as you play your last index stroke. So you are ""loading"" the pinky by curling it as you strike with the index so all you have to do is flick not, load and then flick. It has to be one synchronized motion.",,,,learning
6056,"Maybe we can touch those in stream if you watch it. Otherwise I can give some tips soonish, it's easier by video.",,,,learning

If more of you are working with these (I know you recommended it to me since day 1 <@380654265326370816>) it might be worth setting goals for recording and comparing, if you are into that.

6079,Aww man. I thought it was unique to the program. Yeah that's a really cool fact about him and Paco,,,,learning
6080,It's the same press text he has on his website. Nevertheless enjoyed reading it again. I love the story about Paco and he being each other childrens godfathers. I quoted that several times when people try to compare.,,,,learning

6134,<@738765340909240470> just looked up El arte.   847$ on Amazon.  Gonna pick up the solo flamenco book.,,,,learning
6135,"Awesome, I'll lookout for those, thanks!",,,,learning
6136,Nothing like a 3am drunken Dick's burger though.  Also Schultzy's sausages on University Ave is good.  Get the El Diablo.,,,,learning

6138,"Nice, well it was good talking to you!",,,,learning
6139,I'll check it out.  Gotta make an Amazon order today anyway.,,,,learning
6140,I really like Martinez 's tarantas though.  Quejia I think,,,,learning
6141,"I also tried the graf martin book first. I also felt like the difficulty ramped up quickly.  Then I did juan martin ""el arte flamenco"" and that was better but I still hit a wall. Then someone told me ""solos flamencos"" are supposed to go along with his book and it has way more pieces to learn between his el arte chapters",,,,learning
6142,Yeah.  I'll check out the Juan Martin book.  I have the Graf Martinez book around here somewhere.  It was a little too advanced for me when I first picked up the guitar so I moved to flamenco explained.,,,,learning
6143,They like the other stuff but rumbas makes them want to move lol,,,,learning
6144,Oh so true,,,,learning
6145,Yeah.  And you can play for the uninitiated a lot better.  People who don't know flamenco like rumba.,,,,learning
6146,Yeah rumba is very fun. Once you get comfy and just relax into the beat it's a great time,,,,learning
6147,"I like flamenco explained but I would also recommend juan Martin's ""solos flamencos"". There will be a bunch if pieces you will be able to play right now today haha it's really well graded",,,,learning
6148,Rumba first is cool.  I do like the rumba strumming.,,,,learning
6149,"Oh gotcha, yeah I eases told dancers start in a different spot",,,,learning
6150,"My teacher's diary piece with me was rumba, then tango, then sevillanas, now solea",,,,learning

6152,I would do a tango first,,,,learning
6153,I'm trying to decide on my next Palo and I'm torn between tangos and bulerias,,,,learning
6154,I use flamenco explained and I have a teacher that I get lessons from about once a month.,,,,learning
6155,Oh cool! I really enjoy it too. Are you learning from a book or teacher?,,,,learning
6156,Guitar since last December.  Decided to pick up guitar and then flamenco at almost 40 years old.  It's been fun.,,,,learning
6157,I'm just finishing up my first solea.  I've been playing since about Feb.,,,,learning
6158,So what flamenco do you play<@458416050761891840> ?,,,,learning
6159,Yeah I'd have to ask. I wasn't too sassy it was the midsummer faire but thru definately called their town merrywhether,,,,learning
6160,Ahh.  The one in carnation doesn't move so it must be a different one.,,,,learning
6161,My wife grew up doing that faire with her family,,,,learning
6162,They call the town merrywhether I think,,,,learning
6163,"I'm not sure tbh, I think is called orby? They travel through Washington and Oregon",,,,learning
6164,Which fair?  The one in carnation?,,,,learning
6165,They do that at fair too,,,,learning
6166,"Oh cool, yeah I bet that really helps out",,,,learning
6167,I really want to pull a dancer and dinner for the renaissance festival,,,,learning
6168,My wife is a belly dance instructor but her dance style already incorporates a lot of flamenco posture etc. So she's advancing quickly.,,,,learning
6169,Yeah :/ tent cities,,,,learning
6170,I'd live if my wife took dance or even palmas and castenetas,,,,learning
6171,I left in 2006 I imagine it's gotten a lot worse since then.,,,,learning
6172,Hey that sounds awesome!,,,,learning
6173,These homeless are a little scary out here tbh lol compared to where I moved from anyway,,,,learning

6176,I just moved here lol taking lessons in seattle with a flamenco couple,,,,learning
6177,I grew up in Seattle.  :-) nice town.  Expensive though.,,,,learning
6178,So what flamenco stuff have you done so far?,,,,learning
6179,Oh man thanks lol Yeah the food there was great. I'll be at the orfy renaissance faire touring through Washington. Once I hook up with a dance singer that want to do that too it will be killer. Till then I'll solo if I'm ready,,,,learning
6180,"Beautiful cities. I lived in SD for a bit and man the mexican food there is amazing. I've visited Seattle a few times, I like the weather actually. And the air quality there is just so much better than Los Angeles. I'm counting on you to start a big flamenco scene there so next time I visit I can go to many flamenco shows üòâ",,,,learning

6184,Whereabouts are you?,,,,learning
6185,"Same. My teachers side is s dance instructor, so once quarantine lifts I can play with her students",,,,learning
6186,I'm currently self-learning right now and will be looking for a local teacher once this pandemic calms down. My goals are to accompany singers/dancers first.,,,,learning
6187,"Yeah I'm trying to get the thumb drag technique down as well. I'm kind of following your footsteps, right now I'm focusing on Juan Martin's materials and so far I really like it.",,,,learning
6188,"Thanks! Tone is important to my teacher so he really drilled with me. Same with the thumb drags, they should be slower than a strum. Moher live a fast arpeggio",,,,learning

I get that fight or flight response all the time and my heartbeat goes up and it's not comfortable. But if you choose to stay rather than runaway, and you've prepared well and you believe in your abilities, your performance has the chance to transcend your previous best. You can't get that kind of performance in a recording studio because it's all too safe. You'll never find the duende hanging around in such a space. The sooner you get comfortable with being uncomfortable, the better performer you'll become because you'll just have more reps in than the person who is risk-averse and quits because he thinks I just don't have it in me. And don't forget that the people who spend their time to listen to your performance want you to succeed even if they might not understand the music as well as you do. So the sense of fear is completely artificial. There is no lion in front of you to kill you. You're invulnerable. Worst case scenario, you feel embarrassed but you'll live and learn from your mistakes. No one is going to come to you and say, ""Hey remember that time you messed up at 2:55 of your performance at measure 92? Boy, that was something huh?"" Today, we have technology like Twitch and live YouTube to replicate that feeling of being in public's eyes.

6394,"Hey <@!300157987430072321> , there's a lot of content on youtube. I think you learn more efficiently when you are working on the pieces you are really passionate about. I suggest going on to youtube when you have spare time and searching for beginner tutorials and you'll start to develop an idea of what you like and then watch those creator's content. Kai's videos are helpful to understand the compas (the rhythmic structures and the rules for each palo) so you can use flamenco explained for developing the fundmanetals but as for the piece variety, one way is to get a private teacher to help cater to your tastes. This is the most time efficient way but of course it is the most expensive option.",,,,learning

6396,"Hey guys, how you tackled getting used to different voices and what to implement on your playing? I'm here wondering how to keep improving beyond what kai taught in flamenco explained (just soleas for now)... I know I have plenty to improve in every technique, but just keep practicing what he gave me there isn't the right way right? Any tips on what's next? These last days I've just been sitting trying to get used to the fretboard and find the chords with those intervals, but I'm afraid I'm not being efficient :p
Maybe look for a solea piece and give it a try and get used to more sounds than those presented to me so far?

6473,"Your playing is very rhythmical which I like a lot and is most important in flamenco. Many lack that for a long time. You also catch that bulerias feeling. Some technical points I found that you might want to improve on: as fierce as your 1 finger rasgueados already sounds, the thumb sounds too soft. You want to use rest stroke with the thumb almost all the time (except when you play an adjacent string with another finger right afterwards), so it does sound like a stroke rather than petting the string. You also might want to slowly practice rasgueado en abanico to have individual strong strokes there as well.
First  bulerias huh? ""damn"" pretty much nails it.üí™ I strongly recommend to begin with soleares though, which are kind of slow  bulerias in some aspects but you have more time to concentrate on sound and technique. The feeling is different but the technique transitions from one to the other.",,,,learning

And I love your approach to practicing. I've just finished reading Atomic Habits today and one of the arguments there is that in oreder to stick to a habit you should make it easy.
Going to gym converts into just putting on running shoes etc.
And that's exactly what you are doing, practicing the guitar converts into playing one exercise. If you have more time it's great and this small habit makes you dive into a longer practice. And if you don't have time that day so at least you haven't broken the chain.
There are days when I want to practice  but as I think about the amount of exercises I need to do I procrastinate on it until the end of day and don't practice at all. I must adopt your mindset and system.

About the muffled sound. I believe it's a mixture of 3 things, it's a classical guitar, it's older strings and I very much believe that my tone got a lot more consistency in being ""even"" in both sound and loudness.

For the rumba I can not give you a lot of feedback other than it sounds nice (I never got into rumba myself)
For the tango, some things that caught my attention:
Your technique in general got a lot better cleaner and more crispy. I like that. Especially the index golpe is way on point. Your rasgueados are fluent, sound separated and Individually played like they should, maybe you want to extend the fingers a little more though. I would have preferred to listen to it while in tune (first put on the capo, then tune to the tones accordingly) and about 1/4 slower so it gets more of a groove. As for alzapua you want to practice it very slowly and with an even pulse.",,,,learning

6685,"Thank you everyone for taking your time and explaining your thoughts on this. I really appreciate that and can take a lot out of it. Coincidentally I found out that Brandon Acker uploaded his part 2 of classical tremolo just recently, and he puts Rubato as the last discipline when learning tremolo. His tremolo is really fascinating (pami instead piami, but heck you can practice both) It kinda goes hand in hand with what sense said.
I think I might have a new contender for my daily routine in 73 days when my picado challenge is over (if I don't screw up until then üòÖ)
Thx again!",,,,learning
6686,"<@!316154052364992512>  In my opinion, you practice it right, I think you should aim for an even tremolo and then, after you have developed the right mind-muscle connection you can twist it as you like without affecting your technique.
 My tremolo was very unequal and I was like ""it sounds good, so what?"" but no, it's not the right attitude, it's just an excuse no to bring down the metronome's speed and concentrate on playing evenly. On the other hand, Grisha Goryachev told me that many flamenco players play tremolo unevenly but maybe there is a good reason for this and they do it because of muscial reasons.
and about your second question, it looks like he is crossing strings during the tremolo, I mean he plays i on the second strings and then ami on the first string and maybe he stops between them. But you have transcribed the video so you would have noticed if there are crossings.

And as for exercises for tremolo and warmup these are my favorites:

6687,Yes I also agree with sense,,,,learning
6688,"Thank you <@380654265326370816> , that makes a lot of sense üòÖ that's the advice I was looking for. üëç
I also put more thought into it and I guess once I'm satisfied with my even and controlled tremolo, I still can implement the hesitating musical expressions.",,,,learning
6689,"It really depends like you said, if you want it to be a warm up routine or an exercise for tremolo, playing it evenly in a controlled way is probably better than trying to play musically from the get-go. If you plan to use this piece as part of your repertoire, then you should practice as you want to perform which at that point would not be a warm up anymore. In my opinion, warm ups are more about focusing on individual techniques rather than making a song sound nice because that involves a lot of moving pieces and your goal is to literally warm your fingers up. If warm ups become too complicated and take too much concentration, you'll be overworked by the time you need to work on your falseta, etc. In this case, the exercise piece is also nice to play which is like an etude. It really is up to you, I don't think there is a wrong way. But personally, I want my warm up exercises to be as focused and simple as possible so I might just hold one chord down and do tremolo repetitions while varying the rhythm, velocity, or attack.",,,,learning
6690,In terms of technique I'll stick to Brandon Ackers tutorial and just replace the exercises with quintuplets. BTW he mentions the staccato exercise as well.,,,,learning

6709,"> I really like the feeling you put into the songs lately. Emotion clearly is on your side, you play this as well as the solea very lyrically. If anything I find, for my taste, your videos might lack a little ""flamenco fire"", especially the rasgueados are on the softer side. Imo it would benefit from more punch. Your 3 finger rasgueados seem to be one motion rather than 3 individual strong strokes played in quick succession. Did you train each finger separately?

<@!316154052364992512> thanks for the comment, really appreciate this! 
That's exactly what my teacher says, my rasguado are not ""seperated and punchy"" enough. I think something is wrong with my thumb position. I have seen this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myjrxerxhEo it helped a lot in getting a more punchy sound but it was painful for me so I returned to the old position. Maybe I need to practice this position with weak strokes for some time to strengthen my fingers and make them comfortable in this position.

I know your rasgueado are very well and I would like if you could recommend some of the resources you used to learn them.

Thanks again!","YouTube

6925,"because it's unique to flamenco***
I wanted to wright something else and forgot to delete the 'don't see'",,,,learning
6926,"it's one of the hardest technique because you don't see it's unique to flamenco. But about 70% of flamenco is consist of alzapua and rasgueados as my teacher said to me. So it's very important to master these two. Recently I've learned 9 falsetas of Bulerias, 8 of them are only pulgar/alzapua and rasgueado.",,,,learning
6927,"Ok, thank you again !
I think alzapua is the hardest technic in flamenco, what do you think about it ? <@531037498629947394>",,,,learning
6928,"<@!436240394561519616> I also had a confusion and I think it's because when players play it in a ""real time"" they play it very fast and minimum movement so it may look like they don't use their wrist but only thumb as you did but they do use wrist. They do it so fast and little movement that it's hard to notice but it's there.
When you develop your technique and accuracy practice like in this video and after some time you will be able to play it faster while keeping right technique and mechanics.",,,,learning

6932,"My problem in alzapua is that i have 2 diferents ways to play it :

The first one is like on my video i'm faster but it doesn't sounds very good

The second one is like you say, i move my wrist but i took th√© habit to put a golpe each Time when i'm going down. It Can sound good for some falsetas but not for others. I'm working on th√© right way but i see many diferents way from real players",,,,learning
6933,Thanks everyone for your answers ! Now i have to work it !,,,,learning
6934,"Until then I'd not bother too much, there is so much more to put focus on.",,,,learning
6935,"You ultimately want to be able to play every scale/melody starting with either I or m. That's why I started to do my daily picado challenge with both. But in the beginning I wouldn't focus on it too much since it is not wrong. If rather focused on the music first, you'll eventually get stuck at one place or another and find out that starting with the other finger does the trick.",,,,learning
6936,"Thank you very much I'm glad to hear you find it helpful. <@!436240394561519616> about the alzapua, as I said you used only your thumb. Alzapua uses also the wrist, watch this video:

<@!436240394561519616> as <@!316154052364992512> said it's not a problem but there are passages when it's better to start with the middle than the index or the opposite, depends on what comes next. as <@!380654265326370816> just said, you will feel what's more right.",,,,learning
6937,"Yeah, it's totally fine to start in either middle or index. Sometimes it doesn't matter, but say if you want to land on a specific chord, then you have to decide: is the transition easier if I start my picado with middle or index? My rule is to do what feels most natural and comfortable.",,,,learning

1. Your alzapua is all thumb, you don't use your wrist and the hand position isn't. 
2. You start with a good hand position and then you lose it after the first alzapua.
3. Notice your left hand. you don't press in the right place and that's why it sounds like this. Always aim to press as close as possible to the end of the fret.

6967,"Hey <@!436240394561519616> , hope you're doing good! I like that you played without tension. Your hand looks relaxed and your golpes were nicely played. Now that you played through the beginning to the end of the falseta, play it very slowly so that you can get the rhythm down without changes in tempo. Make sure there is no rushing or slowing down like <@!316154052364992512> pointed out. Our guitars also go out of tune when you put a cejilla (capo) so make sure to check your tuning as well. For the rasqueados, be careful not to brush the strings (they sound too soft). It should have a snappy, tight sound especially in the tangos. But Andre, good to hear your performance! Thank you üôÇ",,,,learning
6968,"I can't go into detail atm, first thing you a want to make sure your guitar is in tune. Second it seems the major thing to work on  is the tightness, play it slowly and as rhythmically exact as possible. Absolutely use a metronome for that. Some notes seem to be played in a hurry, make sure to play equal attention to every note, like when you talk and mean every word you say. This also gets solved by practicing slowly.
Thx for sharing, it's a very nice falseta! Good luck",,,,learning

Little did I know, that concert would inspire me to go home and listen to a bunch of flamenco music. I had an acoustic guitar that was collecting dust so I took it out, try to copy Vicente and of course I failed miserably. I researched a bit, and despite what some people say online (that he is overrated, not the best, etc.), I found Juan Martin's traditional style to be a great starting point for my journey so I bought his books. Doing rasqueados on an acoustic steel string guitar was horrible and around February 2019, I bought a used Yamaha flamenco guitar off ebay. And shortly after, I found this discord community.

7011,"Hey guys, I wonder if you'd join if we did a ""share a falseta"" or ""share a remate""  either here or in the falseta channel.

I figured since most of us are stuck at home and everyone has a camera on the phone, we could use this to
1) expand each other's faleseta/remate vocabulary
2) grow closer as a community (even the most basic remate would suffice for that)
3) work against the stage/cam fright some might have (easier when many do it, and a one bar basic remate should be manageable for everyone)

Good or dumb idea?",,,,learning

7040,Are you playing the open F chord or the barred F chord?,,,,learning
7041,I mean I can do e's and A's and I can even get to a decent f.  it's just switching between the chords that has me confused.,,,,learning

7044,Without taking a full minute to find the chord.,,,,learning
7045,Ah okay. What kind of chord shapes can you play?,,,,learning
7046,Right now I have been working on bulerias.  But it's hard to say I'm working on any compas.  cuz right now I'm just trying to figure out how to play chords and scales.,,,,learning

7053,"<@!458416050761891840> no, Skype lesson are another thing. I havn't checked but I feel he might be a little bit expensive. But very worth it if you can afford it.",,,,learning
7054,Does kai offer Skype lessons with his subscription?,,,,learning
7055,"Moreover, just try and see what works for you. I started with Youtube videos and felt it's not enough so I bout Orhan's fundamentals course. It was ok but I still felt I was missing something so I started to look for online teachers, I tried three different teachers and another site of one of these teachers and finally I decided to go with my current teacher because I felt a good connection with him, I like his temper and it seems he knows what he talk about.",,,,learning
7056,"<@!458416050761891840> haha it's not my fault they are both good. I reccomnded on Orhan because I shared his falsetas and we discussed about them. But as I think about it, maybe it's better to befin with Kai because he really explains in depth and step by step. Orhan's courses go like this: Short videos of 2-4 minutes and then an exercise with tabs and his video playing that slow and then in normal speed. In the techniques package it's only his videos play the falseta slowly and then in normal speed. It;s good mostly for people who already play and want to learn more falsetas and get a better understaing of the compas. But if starting from ground zero, maybe Kai is a better option.",,,,learning
7057,<@531037498629947394> you're killing me man. I was just about to get the package from ohan on your recommendation.  Now you're saying go with Kai?  This is why I'm making no progress...  üòù,,,,learning
7058,<@!458416050761891840> this is a good plan. But maybe because of this unique situation try one Skype lesson and see how it goes. Also I heard the Kai's website is very resourceful. You get a week or two for free and you can go for only one month subscription and see how it goes.,,,,learning
7059,"I'm down, it would have to be on a Sunday afternoon cuz those are the only days I have off.",,,,learning
7060,Maybe we can do like a zoom meeting at some point. I need to learn how that works first. I've never hosted one before. It's like skype but it hosts multiple people as if we are all in one room. Not sure how everyone feels about video conferencing but it could be interesting to experiment!,,,,learning
7061,Thats awesome.,,,,learning
7062,"Yeah, I figure I'd start off with a couple personal lessons and then switch to Skype once I felt like I had a good foundation.",,,,learning
7063,"For example, I took a lesson once with Grisha Goryachev. He is so sharp and experienced that he noticed very very little things in my playing which hold me back and explained me how to improve them and it went good.",,,,learning
7064,"<@!458416050761891840> look, regular lessons are much better, nothing can replace it. But if it's your only option it's better than studying on your own. It also depends on the teacher, a good teacher knows what to look for and knoes how to explain the concepts through the computer.",,,,learning
7065,For me it's about 2 and 1/2 hours each way.  So it's essentially my whole day when I go.  But I go with my wife and we do some shopping and make a day out of it.,,,,learning
7066,Damn that is a long commute...,,,,learning
7067,"To the nearest teacher I have to travel 1:15-1:30 hours each direction because I use public transportation and the traffic jams.. and another hour for the lesson, so 4 hours are wasted.",,,,learning
7068,How do you Skype lessons compare to regular lessons?,,,,learning
7069,"<@!458416050761891840> I understand, this was my case so that's why I take Skype lessons.",,,,learning
7070,My issue is I have to drive two hours to the nearest teacher.,,,,learning
7071,<@!380654265326370816> I have a lesson every two weeks. It's more comfortable with time and budget although maybe not ideal like a lesson every week.,,,,learning

7085,The problem I'm having is that the Graf Martinez book seems to assume more guitar knowledge than I have and some very basic stuff I feel like I'm missing.  And now with this virus it's going to be even longer before I can get some lessons.  I'll check it out.,,,,learning
7086,"Watch his flamenco 101 then, it's very similar to the fundamentals package in my opinion.",,,,learning
7087,I might do that.  But my base is very flimsy.  I figured be it might be more in depth than the book I've been working out of.,,,,learning
7088,"thanks!
If you have some base I recommend getting straight to the flamenco guitar techniques package.
The fundamentals package is very similar to flamenco 101 on his Youtube channel. In the techniques package you go straigh to learning falsetas with different technique emphazise in 5 different palos. And you have some falsetas with mixed techniques.",,,,learning

7191,"<@!316154052364992512> thank you! I also think that Bulerias should be kept for the later stages when studying Flamenco. I even feel that maybe I started a little bit early but my teacher sasys I'm ready so I trust him.

7203,"After 65 days, with 117 days left, I failed to practice my picado yesterday üòî
Reset.
But I'm happy where my first try got me, on multiple layers.
Besides speed: tone, control, ease when playing short picado parts in actual music, self esteem when it comes to technique, focusing on relaxing, controlling the mind by not thinking too much about little things (think of one or two notes rather than the phrase and you'll play it wrong)

I'll definitely start my second try today.",,,,learning

7209,First getting started it can help to practice close to the bridge where the string is a little stiffer,,,,learning
7210,"Yeah, I think it's a combination of me playing way too hard and positioning my thumb in the wrong spot.",,,,learning
7211,i tend to bend my thumb a bit when i want to make sure I hit the 5th string with some accenting but it is not a hook where the thumb gets stuck,,,,learning
7212,"it's okay to add a little bit a pressure to keep the thumb stationary (string can bend slightly), but not so much that it tenses up your playing hand.",,,,learning
7213,I figured it out.  The trick is to rest of thumb behind the sound hole. That way it can't fit behind the strings.,,,,learning
7214,Rather than hooking it around,,,,learning
7215,Try just resting the thump on the low e,,,,learning
7216,Hooking the low e at my first thumb joint.,,,,learning
7217,So I'm practicing rasqueados and I'm finding my thumb is sliding down to hooking the top string after the first couple flicks.   Am I playing to hard or do I need to focus more on keeping the thumb stationary?,,,,learning

this video, again, was recorded without playing beforehand so this is where I am now cold. I will keep it at 160 for a while before increasing speed because what I have learned so far on the 182 day road:

- practice with a metronome
- practice starting with m and with i (the first weeks I started with m only out of comfort... changing now, I want to get starting with i as comfortable as with m before increasing speed)
- relax! it is so helpful to try to relax, breath and not tense up
- I'll try to record myself everyday now for the sake of playing in front of the camera

7235,"It's also to train you play with others strings that are in the way. The first string has nothing in the way (no strings below it) so you can form bad habits by being too liberal with your i a m i movements.

7265,"So getting into picado I have found an exercise by Terry Fleming, a very interesting man with a lot of videos on YouTube explaining things in english and French. He says when playing picado you rather push down than towards the next string.. (video 117) But watch it for yourself, I'm not so good at explaining this.
His video no 118 shows a picado exercise with scales and arpeggios, nothing too hard. He mentioned that it is to be practiced slowly, regularly and for at least half a year. That's why I put a 182 day counter on my phone and use this as my daily routine, to warm up if I have time for more or just to practice this if nothing else. If I skip a day it will reset back to 182..thats why I did it even when I was sick 2 weeks ago üòÇ

7272,"Yeah, warming up and stretching are very important. I also don't really care to do it although I should.
But I meant that when you play only 20 minutes it's maybe not enough time to get warmed and opened. When you practice 60 minutes you get warmed and opened and it's starts to click in.",,,,learning
7273,Yeah I used to not care about warming up and just getting straight into practice. But more and more I realize it's important to take the time to do so,,,,learning

7275,ü§î I think you just solved the mystery with that explanation lol thanks!,,,,learning
7276,That‚Äôs your playing improving with practice brother,,,,learning
7277,"One strange thing I've been noticing is, the longer you play the guitar, the guitar starts to sound a lot better. I'm not sure if there's actual physical change that's going on with the guitar ""opening up"" or if it just psychological. There's a difference when I practice just 20 minutes vs. 60 minutes. Almost always, after 60 minutes, the guitar starts to sound like a Conde üòÑ",,,,learning

7341,"So after you use these ""cheat sheets"" several times you start to remember where every note is on the guitar. I had used it long time ago so I forgot. 
But remember that Flamenco is not a music sheet or a book or a piece by Paco. It's a tradition and general idea that has passed throgh the generation. People listened to other players and tried to repeat, only in modern times people started to organize it into books, notes and pieces. 
My teacher plays the falseta slowly and I repeat after him and then he sends me a video of him plays it slowly and I repeat until I remember it. The same method is used on many Youtube videos, they explain slowly what they do and you repeat after them, and some of them share tabs. So I think that reading sheet music is nice but it's not a must. 
And don't aim to play like me, aim to be much much better, I'm not that good. I believe that with a well organized effort you can acheive it in a year or two. But I highly recommend to look for a good mentor who can guide throgh it. Even Skype lessons are a good way.",,,,learning

I first picked up the guitar 8 years ago when I was 12. But actually I played only 3.5 years with lonk breaks between (it's kind of a funny story, I can tell it if you are interested). I decided to start again seriously a year ago. 2 months with Youtube and online courses and 9 months with teacher, a lesson every two weeks. 
About the nails, I keep their length as in this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46-0T7h3shg&feature=youtu.be 
I was used to bite on my nails but once I decided I'm gonna stop and grow them I felt the difference in playing and it was huge. I highly recommend keeping your nails grown out. 
I read some sheet music, I use this ""cheat sheets"":","YouTube

7350,<@531037498629947394>  that sounds awesome. A few questions if you dont mind. How long have you been playing for? Do you have your nails grown out? Cause I always go back and forth on that. And do you read sheet music? Im holding back on that cause I find it boring so want to see just how much I need to learn. Thanks and great work. Hope to play like that one day.,,,,learning
7351,"Sounds beautiful <@531037498629947394> . Must have taken a lot of hard work to get the full recording down like that. Are you doing your apoyando mostly with the flesh of your thumb? I was taught that both the nail and callous should be used to produce a driving tone with good body. So if I were to point one thing out is that the root notes being played sounds a bit too rounded (for me), instead of an accented/dynamic feel. But man, nice performance overall. I need to learn this piece at some point!",,,,learning

Yeah, Grisha Goryachev. He's a technique monster! Recently he dropped his price to 50$ per hour because he aims to reach more people. It's a very good price but still a little bit pricy for common folks like me üòÇ But I felt I must use this opportunity and have at least one masterclass with this technique monster.

His main pointers were:
1. Thumb plays free strokes and not rest stroke. When using a rest stroke all your hand moves down and it interrupts the tremolo.
2. He noticed the muscle that moves the pinky is tight (who the hell notices this? üòÇ ) so he told me to keep it loose and make sure my pinky is a little bit forward in relation to the other fingers.
3. Returning my fingers back into place as fast as possible.
and then he gave me some drills...

If you have the time and money I highly recommend to take a lesson with him.

Thank you for the kind words üôÇ",,,,learning

I worked on a nice tremolo falseta but then I had a Skype lesson with Grisha and I realized my technique is shitty. So I have to work up from ground zero again.
Moreover, I worked on two falsetas which emphasize picado. They are pretty similar and they are both confusing so it took me a while to remember them. I still play them slowly but I continue to work on them.

I used to make transcribing a routine to learn it, transcribe little pieces of music, or even a 2 bar lick, but do it at least 3 times a week. Transcribing helps on many layers. Understanding notation obviously, sight reading, rhythmical understanding, ear training, harmonic and metric understanding.. And a lot more I guess.

Against every advice I practiced my tremolo on my silent gutar while watching tv and am amazed of how good it works for 2 weeks of regular tremolo practice.

Anyways, fell free to comment on the score but keep in mind that after the tremolo it is even more rubato than the first part, you need to listen to it several times when learning.

Oh and the circled numbers are not the stings but the fingers of the left hand. there is no other way to display them in my program.

I'm done with the tremolo part just to find out that the last part after the tremolos he plays something different every time...

7784,Where does your gut feeling tell you to go in the electric world? Which genre?,,,,guitars
7785,"I'm glad. You can play it unplugged but I strongly recommend using an amp as often as possible because it really is part of the instrument. Don't get any effects, get used to creating sound with your hands/guitar/amp. Clean, gain/distortion and a slight reverb get you very far. Reverb shouldn't be noticeable yet shouldn't be missing. Just put so much on it that you neither notice it nor notice the lack of it, if that makes any sense..",,,,guitars
7786,"No this is very informative and I appreciate the details üëç I think it's going to be a strat for my first electric guitar. Would you say it makes sense to use them as ""silent guitars"" by using them to play without amplification? I was looking for a silent guitar for practicing at night, but I might just save money and go for a electric guitar to practice chord progressions, scales, etc and then when I need a break from flamenco, play electric guitar.",,,,guitars

Not being able to afford anything but the cheap strat copy for a long time naturally made me a strat player. I like its versatility, definitely my main driver when I got to play gigs with different styles like weddings.",,,,guitars
7789,"Why post my guitars though? The ugly green cheapo, a Yamaha pac√≠fica 112 for ‚Ç¨150, got me through conservatory and university. I played my best gigs with it. I have it for around 20 years now. It's far from perfect, and I'm not a fan of Yamahas politics, but I got lucky to get a good cheap one AND I strongly believe that over so many years the guitar and your hands learn to get along with each other better.

7849,"It looks like that's just the dark finish wearing off your fretboard. I'm not an expert in guitar building but seeing that the C40 guitar has a rosewood fretboard, I would guess that Yamaha added a finish to make it look like a dark ebony fretboard. As long as there are no cracks, I think you're fine. For instance, on my guitar there are some shiny spots where I play often. In your case, the spots starting to show the wood that's underneath the coat of dark finish. That would be my guess <@!391975837634658316> .",,,,guitars

7851,I‚Äôm new to classical guitars. I have noticed fingerprint discolouration on my C40 guitar fret board. Is this normal will it cause damage to the guitar ?,,,,guitars

7862,How much is that silent guitar?  Can you pull the black frame part off to pack it?  I want!,,,,guitars
7863,Guess his bad is my luck. I felt strange taking opportunities but she ensured me to throw it away on the next day,,,,guitars

Why does he keep buying so much things?",,,,guitars
7865,"There is this old Lady whose son apparently buys a lot of stuff, never uses it and piles it up. She throws things away every now and then. When she saw the instrument (believing it's a strange fiddle) she asked me to have a look at the pile and take what I want before she throws it away. Silent guitar, mics, some video games and toys, a Dslr bag and some other stuff, used once at max.",,,,guitars

7912,"But if you are looking for one of the most affordable flamenco guitar, I have yet to find a better value than the Yamaha flamenco. Spending more will get you better sound of course but it's up to your budget limits.",,,,guitars
7913,"<@!458416050761891840> Yes, I am in the US.",,,,guitars
7914,"I think starting on classical is fine, much better than starting on steel string guitar. But if you think flamenco is something you want to keep exploring, having a dedicated flamenco guitar is so much better for your playing and developing the technique that's unique to flamenco.",,,,guitars
7915,"Have you checked this one out? https://www.amazon.com/Yamaha-CG172SF-String-Flamenco-Guitar/dp/B004MDKTIY/ It's a solid top guitar, rest of the body is laminate. Comes with proper flamenco action and pickguard. I would say it's a very decent beginner flamenco guitar. And if you outgrow it, this model is very popular so you should be able to sell it without too much loss. Or just keep it and use it as a practice guitar, outdoor playing etc.",,https://www.amazon.com/Yamaha-CG172SF-String-Flamenco-Guitar/dp/B004MDKTIY/,,guitars
7916,Are you in the US?,,,,guitars
7917,"<@!316154052364992512> Im not necessarily tied to any brand, I just want a decent idea of what the range of beginner flamenco guitars looks like.",,,,guitars
7918,<@!391975837634658316> what parts of the C40 are flamenco? To my knowledge the C40 has zero of the attributes unique to flamenco guitars.,,,,guitars
7919,If you like Yamaha there are  CG172SF and the 182 equivalent,,,,guitars
7920,I only know classical c40s,,,,guitars
7921,"I just bought a c40 , I just love it I had a f310 before. Is c40 not considered as flamenco/classical guitar?",,,,guitars
7922,Sounds about right <@458416050761891840>,,,,guitars
7923,525$ is about right for a low end specialty instrument like a flamenco guitar.  Intermediate range will normally be around 1500$,,,,guitars
7924,"I have a classical guitar (C40) but wanted to get a beginner flamenco guitar. I saw in the channel that people recommend the Alhambra 4f which is about $525. Are there any other ""good"" beginner guitars people would recommend other than the 4F. 

Maybe my perception of guitar price is a incorrectly skewed, but $525 seems little steep for a beginner instrument.",,,,guitars
7925,"I like all the styles of guitar, it just happens that this one is going to be a bit of my *lifetime project*",,,,guitars
7926,"I have the same brand of local guitar (classical) which I continue to learn jazz on but hoo wee at $1,000 I'd rather play it safe with a Cordoba GK or get something else like a Fender Telecaster with a Marshall Origin but hey thats just me",,,,guitars
7927,same actually,,,,guitars
7928,"A good seller can make a cheap guitar sound good on audio by playing well and good mic setup. I guess it's up to your price limits. If I'm shopping for a starter guitar or something I want to play at the park that I wouldn't mind being banged up or worst case stolen, it's okay to buy without testing in real life. But at $1,000 +, personally, I'm a bit uncomfortable.",,,,guitars
7929,"I think audio alone doesn't tell the truth. Of course sound is important, but you have to factor in playability. Like how does the guitar feel. Does it respond quick to your playing, etc. An expensive guitar worthy of its asking price is usually super easy to play, everything just feels and sounds right.",,,,guitars

7952,"I know guitar tuner and it's good for the variety of functions. Out of the tuner apps I tried it is the least exact one though, even the metronome sometimes used to be uneven (both in timing and in volume). Tuna tip: set it so precise tuning in the settings and everything between -2 and +2 should be acceptable.. Real tuners over apps anytime. But apps over sleepy ears (sometimes ears just don't want to work, especially when the day was long already)",,,,guitars
7953,"Jep, nylon is definitely the most sensitive. Stretching beforehand, when changing strings, really works wonders though.",,,,guitars
7954,"Yeah my guitar even after I tune it, if I take it to another room, it goes out of tune (not by a lot but usually the bottom strings). If I go outside to practice (sorry neighbors) my guitar goes out of tune more. My acoustic guitar doesn't do this but I think nylon is more sensitive to temperature changes.",,,,guitars
7955,I got this app called guitartuna.   Its free for androids and seems to do the job well.,,,,guitars
7956,Lately I'm tuning with an actual tuner more than by ear just because I finally found a clip on tuner without cell battery but with a micro USB input for charging üòÖ love that idea,,,,guitars
7957,Thank you guys for the input. It makes sense since I just unpacked the guitar and started tuning them with an app but didn't do the initial manual stretch.,,,,guitars
7958,"1) you always want to play in tune. Your ears will get used to it and by time tuning by ear gets easier.
2) when you change strings you want to manually stretch them and tune again. 3 mons for one string at least, but it would be best to do it for every string until stretching hardly detunes the string at all. It's more work but you will have a lot less of a hassle the weeks afterwards. Totally rewarding",,,,guitars
7959,New strings will keep stretching a lot.  some people will tell you that by the time the strings don't need to be retuned for every practice they're ready to be replaced.,,,,guitars
7960,"I believe you always should tune yiur guitar before practicing.... Since the frequency of the wave depends on how tight it is and changes in tempsrature affects it, you will have to tune it now and then no matter how old is you guitar i believe",,,,guitars
7961,"Rookie question: do you guys find having to tighten the guitar strings everytime you want to play again. Is the fact that is a new guitar and the strings might still be ""stretching""?",,,,guitars
7962,Nice! Congrats and enjoy! I'd love to see updates of your progress!,,,,guitars
7963,Hey guys! I went to the store and have my friend play it. It sounds good for the price. This whole thing of learning guitar is exciting as hell üòÑ,"20200606_131003

7968,"Awesome. Thank you all. I already got blisters from playing with the steel strings. Yeah, i found a friend of mine on facebook that belongs to a professional flamenco group in chicago. Im hoping i can connect with somebody who teaches guitar.",,,,guitars
7969,Alhambra 3f might be worth a try as well,,,,guitars
7970,Or a teacher,,,,guitars
7971,"If you can, take a buddy who plays guitar with you",,,,guitars
7972,"If you want an entry level flamenco, look into Cordoba F7, Yamaha 172SF . These are not made in Spain, but are sufficient to learn all the fundamentals of flamenco techniques. Yamaha is the cheaper one at around $350. But what others said is great too, just get the classical guitar you can afford now and upgrade later.",,,,guitars
7973,also have the option to modify if you desire a flamenco but cant buy one just yet,,,,guitars

7975,"Yeah, I don't think it's too bad of an idea to get like a $100 classical guitar and wait for the right flamenco guitar.  it gives you something to get started on and then when the right guitar comes to you you'll be ready for it.",,,,guitars
7976,cheap classicals are alot better than cheap flamencos (most of the time),,,,guitars
7977,Guitar,,,,guitars
7978,Seems like the best is to go for a classical then get a flamenco one,,,,guitars
7979,Guitar or flamenco.,,,,guitars
7980,<@316154052364992512> i started yesterday üòÖ,,,,guitars
7981,"For me, starting with a nylon string was the best thing.  And then I just waited for a flamenco guitar to come to me.",,,,guitars
7982,"Might have missed it, are you guitar beginner or flamenco beginner?",,,,guitars
7983,never used,,,,guitars
7984,I got mine for 800 and that was a really good deal.  Flamenco guitars are usually around a thousand plus.  At least in the US.     the problem is you can get them in Spain for less but you have to ship them over.,,,,guitars
7985,hate the steel string sm,,,,guitars
7986,steel,,,,guitars
7987,i had classical then steal then flamenco,,,,guitars
7988,"I think a classical can carry you far, and you might enjoy the flamenco one later even more",,,,guitars
7989,How much do you guys think i can get a descently used flamenco guitar for?,,,,guitars
7990,I think mine kicks more than punches lol,,,,guitars
7991,but its also beautiful and delicate,,,,guitars
7992,it is punchy,,,,guitars
7993,i think sometimes punchy is the wrong word though it still describes it very well,,,,guitars
7994,Never hurts to just go check it out unless the seller is weird like you look you buy lol,,,,guitars
7995,"i had a classical first too, much prefer my flamenco",,,,guitars
7996,"Yep yep. Spazz you had a classical first and then you got a flamenco guitar so you know this first hand. I personally wanted the ""punchy"" sound that <@!293823193272156161> mentioned so that's why I didn't go with classical guitar and modifying it etc. But if you like the sound sure man it's your first guitar nylon guitar to learn so what gets you learning quick is good",,,,guitars
7997,Traditionally flamenco guitars were just cheap classical guitars that were modified to have lower action.  But now they are much different in structure etc.  You can modify a classical for a decent start but eventually a flamenco guitar becomes necessary.   the classical guitars are very heavy in the neck and head and this makes things like picado more difficult to do.,,,,guitars
7998,"That's for sure. But used like sense said can be a good option. Ultimately you want to buy what feels good to you. Try not to order online, play before buying.",,,,guitars
7999,more oppertunies to express emotion,,,,guitars
8000,you get a much bettere experience as both a listener and a player,,,,guitars
8001,and pleasant,,,,guitars
8002,classicals and flamencos have so much depth and are just so beautiful,,,,guitars
8003,i stil dont understand why people prefer accoustics,,,,guitars
8004,"I tried looking at flamenco guitars around my area and they are a bit pricier than what i can afford at the moment. I know classical is not the best that is out there, but im sure itll be better than the acustic one i sold with the steel strings",,,,guitars
8005,"That's true. Comes down to what your ears really and the guitars available where you are. In my case, when I went shopping for a used one, entry level classical and flamenco guitar prices were not that different.",,,,guitars
8006,cheap classicals that is ^,,,,guitars
8007,and often actually have quite a bright sound which is ually found in flamenco guitars,,,,guitars
8008,cheaper classicals tend to be more worth while than cheaper flamencos however,,,,guitars
8009,has alot more punch to it,,,,guitars
8010,alot of people use flamencos for classical music and visa versa,,,,guitars
8011,i'd reccomend looking at the sounds of the two guitars rather than the genre,,,,guitars
8012,You can find flamenco guitars for very affordable prices including popular brands like Cordoba,,,,guitars
8013,some classical pieces sound better on a flamenco guitar however,,,,guitars
8014,"Yeah, I googled it and the price is around the same everywhwere. I looked at a few youtube video reviews and they claim valencia is a not a super known brand, but they make good guitars nevertheless",,,,guitars
8015,"In my country, we have guitar center and they have a used section you can browse.",,,,guitars
8016,"There ain't no flamenco guitar for 100 though, is there?",,,,guitars
8017,"If you know you want to play flamenco rather than classical, I would suggest getting a flamenco guitar from the beginning.",,,,guitars
8018,"Classical guitars and flamenco guitars are not the same though. They both use nylon strings and may look the same, but there's some important differences between them. Internal structures are different, flamenco guitars are thinner, lighter, and action is lower as well.",,,,guitars
8019,Google gives me the valencia for 65 Euros. That's what makes me sceptical,,,,guitars
8020,Cool. Thanks for the input guys. I'm going to check it out tomorrow.,,,,guitars
8021,The big thing is to make sure it's a solid wood top.  Spruce or cedar.  Laminate is not going to have a good sound.,,,,guitars
8022,You can get it for less than that,,,,guitars
8023,100 bucks,,,,guitars
8024,"Either way, play and trust your it, of you like it, take it.",,,,guitars
8025,How much are they asking?,,,,guitars
8026,"<@638563203995140109> I don't know valencia, it that price range makes me sceptical. Hardly ever seen a guitar at that price being worth it.. Maybe you want to look for a Yamaha c40. That's a cheaper one and I only have played good ones.",,,,guitars

8033,"Cheesy sh!tpost, arguably nsfw üòã  

Since we are talking about love for flamenco, music, certain Palos, guitarists etc. I want to express my love for my Conde. I know a lot of guitars, cheap and expensive, very good and bad ones. None is quite like my Conde. When I play with it/her, it/she usually has the 3 point contact (both legs and) one of which is my upper body. When I play pieces like soleares, where I play the open low e string, the vibration it produces resonates with my body, like every low E shares warmth to my heart üòÖ ü•∞ üòÖ when I play the electric bass with a good Amp turned to 11 I sure do feel vibrations as well... But this feeling is more tender and warm.. Sounds strange but
that's when I feel the love is in both directions ü§£ 
Nope, no wise words to find here, I just love my guitar ‚ù§Ô∏è

8106,"<@!458416050761891840>Yes, totally! I think that Alhambra's guitars in general offer a very good price to quality ratio.
 700$ is a serious budget for a beginner guitar, the Alhambra 4F is about 525$ so if you want you can get it and keep the change or look into something even more serious. But Alhambra 4F definitely will satisfy you in my opinion.

The best quality woods and the most refined craftsmanship are&nbsp;the benchmark of Spanish guitars. &nbsp;You will find student and beginner models, concert guitars, electrified models with or without cutaway, and even MIDI classical and flamenco guitars in our store. You will also be able to acquire&nbsp;special-sized guitars adapted to your hands. All with a common denominator: Handmade in Spain.
Buy the best flamenco guitars from Spain, home&nbsp;of the flamenco Guitar. Manufacturers such as&nbsp;Alhambra Guitars, Raimundo Guitars, Ramirez guitars, Admira Guitars, Camps Guitars or Prudencio Saez Guitars are famed for being&nbsp;the makers of the best flamenco guitars in the world. At Guitar from Spain you can acquire&nbsp;a flamenco guitar to&nbsp;the highest standards of quality and&nbsp;at the most reasonable&nbsp;price. Whether you play flamenco or any other music style, a flamenco guitar is&nbsp;a comfortable guitar to play, by virtue of&nbsp;its lower action and great playability.
The &quot;flamenca blanca&quot; is the traditional flamenco guitar, handcrafted using&nbsp;the same construction methods as&nbsp;the pioneers&nbsp;of the flamenco guitar. Their&nbsp;legacy has remained intact through generations of Spanish guitar makers. Quality woods such as cypress, spruce or sycamore are used in the manufacture of our guitars.&nbsp;They are punchy and have a short attack with a distinctive tone. They are also lighter than classical guitars.

The &quot;flamenca negra&quot;&nbsp;guitar differs from the &quot;flamenca blanca&quot;&nbsp;in&nbsp;the kind of woods used to make the body. The back and sides of a flamenca negra are made of denser woods, such as rosewood. The purpose&nbsp;is to achieve a greater sound projection and a higher volume. These guitars are ideal for concert flamenco players, and anyone who wants to enjoy a versatile guitar with lower string action.&nbsp;
The artisan series of flamenco guitars represent the top of the line of each manufacturer. They are wholly&nbsp;handmade guitars using the traditional methods of Spanish guitar makers.

Some of them come with electronics and / or with narrow bodies. Among our major suppliers we number&nbsp;Alhambra Guitars, Ramirez Guitars, Raimundo Guitars, Admira Guitars, Camps Guitars and&nbsp;Prudencio Saez Guitars. They have been making handcrafted guitars for decades, and offer the highest standards of quality.

In our range of classical guitars you will find student guitars, concert guitars and professional luthier models.

Classical guitars, handmade in Spain using traditional methods and an excellent selection of solid woods and other high-quality materials are ideal for every advanced guitarist.

Spanish classical guitars fulfill the requisites&nbsp;of both students and teachers for a&nbsp;truly balanced instrument both in sound and action. If your budget allows you to, avoid imitations, as the student will progress more smoothly&nbsp;with a quality guitar. Any of these models will afford you the guarantee of a quality guitar with no tuning problems, as well as&nbsp;encourage&nbsp;you to quickly advance&nbsp;in&nbsp;your&nbsp;guitar playing technique.

Traditional methods of spanish guitar making are employed in the construction process, meaning each piece is unique and has its own feel and particular sound. Using only the finest&nbsp;materials, these instruments are produced by&nbsp;the master luthiers of each guitar house, with the&nbsp;longest experience in their art.&nbsp;They represent a great investment for guitar lovers and collectors.

Tradition meets innovation to achieve&nbsp;the finest&nbsp;performing guitars for stage and studio. Among our major suppliers we encompass&nbsp;Alhambra Guitars, Ramirez Guitars, Raimundo Guitars, Admira Guitars, Camps Guitars and Prudencio Saez Guitars
The cutaway classical guitar models&nbsp;embody&nbsp;the consolidation&nbsp;of the most up-to-date&nbsp;guitar playing techniques to the classical and flamenco guitar. These guitars combine&nbsp;the quality and craftsmanship of traditional Spanish guitars with a cutaway body to allow easier&nbsp;access to the upper&nbsp;frets on the fingerboard. Some of them come with electronics on board and/or with narrow bodies. Among our major suppliers we include&nbsp;Alhambra Guitars, Ramirez Guitars, Raimundo Guitars, Admira Guitars, Camps Guitars and&nbsp;Prudencio Saez Guitars.
Here you can find premium&nbsp;steel-stringed acoustic guitars, handcrafted&nbsp;using the&nbsp;techniques and craftsmanship of primo&nbsp;Spanish luthiers. With unique features such as&nbsp;the &quot;Spanish Heel&quot; these guitars have been crafted using&nbsp;only the finest&nbsp;woods. They are available&nbsp;in different sizes and formats: jumbo guitars, dreadnought guitars or auditorium guitars; full-body or cutaway body. For the same price as a mass produced guitar made in Asia, you will be able to pick up&nbsp;unique acoustic guitar made in Spain with passion, patience and love.
Spanish classical guitars and flamenco guitars with MIDI system on board from prestigious&nbsp;Spanish guitar makers Ramirez guitars, Raimundo guitars and&nbsp;Camps guitars. The MIDI device works rather like&nbsp;a language; a protocol that uses a digital signal previously coded by controllers. This enables any MIDI instrument to communicate with other machines including&nbsp; PC and MAC computers, synthesizers, sound modules, score editors, and other software.
Thin body classical and flamenco guitars. These guitars have a standard 4/4 body&nbsp;but the depth of the guitar is narrower for extra comfort and lightness. Despite their narrower bodies, thin bodied guitars&nbsp;maintain&nbsp;an excellent sound and volume when not amplified. They are also less sensitive to unwanted feedback than full bodied electro-classical guitars.
The Crossover guitar&nbsp;has a&nbsp;classical guitar body&nbsp;with&nbsp;cutaway,&nbsp;and a narrower neck with some radius in the fingerboard. They normally come electrified with&nbsp;piezo electric pickup&nbsp;and Preamp, but you can buy them with&nbsp;no&nbsp;electrification system. The targeted guitarist for the&nbsp;Crossover guitar&nbsp;is the&nbsp;electric guitar player&nbsp;and the&nbsp;acoustic guitar player&nbsp;that finds the neck of the classical or&nbsp;flamenco guitars&nbsp;too wide or&nbsp;too flat for their playing techniques.&nbsp;
The Baritone guitar is an innovative and niche instrument that is a relatively new addition to&nbsp;the guitar&nbsp;family. Considering the standard guitar as a Tenor instrument, opposed to the Requinto or Soprano guitar, undoubtedly this new instrument covers the lower range existing between the Bass and the standard guitar, so its sound falls perfectly as a Baritone guitar.
The early&nbsp;romantic guitar&nbsp;is the guitar of the Classical and Romantic period of music, showing remarkable consistency in the instrument from 1790 to 1830.&nbsp;A small bodied classic, with a huge voice built deeper than the traditional classic guitar. Beautiful, elegant and thoroughly classic, the&nbsp;Classic Romantic guitar is a dream for the passionate and a virtual necessity for the discerning musician
Special&nbsp;size guitars made with the same specifications and materials of standard size guitars but adapted to smaller scale length. Smaller sized acoustic guitars ideal for the younger ones&nbsp;or for&nbsp;guitarists with small hands. Have a look at our catalog and choose your special size guitar.

The artisan series of Classical Guitars represents the top of the line of each manufacturer and each of these instruments is&nbsp;entirely&nbsp;handmade. Traditional methods of spanish guitar making are employed in the construction process, meaning each piece is unique and has its own feel and particular sound. Using only the finest&nbsp;materials, these instruments are produced by&nbsp;the master luthiers of each guitar house, with the&nbsp;longest experience in their art.&nbsp;They represent a great investment for guitar lovers and collectors. Among our major suppliers we count&nbsp;Alhambra Guitars, Ramirez Guitars, Raimundo Guitars, Camps Guitars and Prudencio Saez Guitars.
Electro-Acoustic guitars with nylon strings or Electro-Classical guitars made in Spain with first-rate&nbsp;preamps and pickups from Fishman, Roland, RMC, Shadow and other premium acoustic pickup manufactures. Tradition meets innovation to achieve&nbsp;the finest&nbsp;performing guitars for stage and studio. Among our major suppliers we encompass&nbsp;Alhambra Guitars, Ramirez Guitars, Raimundo Guitars, Admira Guitars, Camps Guitars and Prudencio Saez Guitars
The cutaway classical guitar models&nbsp;embody&nbsp;the consolidation&nbsp;of the most up-to-date&nbsp;guitar playing techniques to the classical and flamenco guitar. These guitars combine&nbsp;the quality and craftsmanship of traditional Spanish guitars with a cutaway body to allow easier&nbsp;access to the upper&nbsp;frets on the fingerboard. Some of them come with electronics on board and/or with narrow bodies. Among our major suppliers we include&nbsp;Alhambra Guitars, Ramirez Guitars, Raimundo Guitars, Admira Guitars, Camps Guitars and&nbsp;Prudencio Saez Guitars.
Here you can find premium&nbsp;steel-stringed acoustic guitars, handcrafted&nbsp;using the&nbsp;techniques and craftsmanship of primo&nbsp;Spanish luthiers. With unique features such as&nbsp;the &quot;Spanish Heel&quot; these guitars have been crafted using&nbsp;only the finest&nbsp;woods. They are available&nbsp;in different sizes and formats: jumbo guitars, dreadnought guitars or auditorium guitars; full-body or cutaway body. For the same price as a mass produced guitar made in Asia, you will be able to pick up&nbsp;unique acoustic guitar made in Spain with passion, patience and love.
Spanish classical guitars and flamenco guitars with MIDI system on board from prestigious&nbsp;Spanish guitar makers Ramirez guitars, Raimundo guitars and&nbsp;Camps guitars. The MIDI device works rather like&nbsp;a language; a protocol that uses a digital signal previously coded by controllers. This enables any MIDI instrument to communicate with other machines including&nbsp; PC and MAC computers, synthesizers, sound modules, score editors, and other software.
Thin body classical and flamenco guitars. These guitars have a standard 4/4 body&nbsp;but the depth of the guitar is narrower for extra comfort and lightness. Despite their narrower bodies, thin bodied guitars&nbsp;maintain&nbsp;an excellent sound and volume when not amplified. They are also less sensitive to unwanted feedback than full bodied electro-classical guitars.
The Crossover guitar&nbsp;has a&nbsp;classical guitar body&nbsp;with&nbsp;cutaway,&nbsp;and a narrower neck with some radius in the fingerboard. They normally come electrified with&nbsp;piezo electric pickup&nbsp;and Preamp, but you can buy them with&nbsp;no&nbsp;electrification system. The targeted guitarist for the&nbsp;Crossover guitar&nbsp;is the&nbsp;electric guitar player&nbsp;and the&nbsp;acoustic guitar player&nbsp;that finds the neck of the classical or&nbsp;flamenco guitars&nbsp;too wide or&nbsp;too flat for their playing techniques.&nbsp;
The Baritone guitar is an innovative and niche instrument that is a relatively new addition to&nbsp;the guitar&nbsp;family. Considering the standard guitar as a Tenor instrument, opposed to the Requinto or Soprano guitar, undoubtedly this new instrument covers the lower range existing between the Bass and the standard guitar, so its sound falls perfectly as a Baritone guitar.
The early&nbsp;romantic guitar&nbsp;is the guitar of the Classical and Romantic period of music, showing remarkable consistency in the instrument from 1790 to 1830.&nbsp;A small bodied classic, with a huge voice built deeper than the traditional classic guitar. Beautiful, elegant and thoroughly classic, the&nbsp;Classic Romantic guitar is a dream for the passionate and a virtual necessity for the discerning musician

Smaller sized acoustic guitars ideal for the younger ones&nbsp;or for&nbsp;guitarists with small hands. Have a look at our catalog and choose your special size guitar.

It's 4 mics in one, can record sorround but the best thing it works as an audio interface out of the box. Just plug it into the pc OR fairly recently discovered into the smartphone and you can record your videos with using the zoom as mic. No further settings/tweekings needed (on Android).

<@!316154052364992512> You are not harsh, I agree with you but there are several points:
a. I believe that in life we should chase opportunities and not dreams. I can dream of being an important CEO or selling person but reality is right here. I should realize what I'm good at, what I can achieve with the highest probability, what are my opportunities and work my ass of until I reach them.
b. Speaking with people is really frustrating when you stutter.

<@!380654265326370816> You are right but the basics are the same. Every profession today changes very quick, if you want to master your profession you must be a permanent learner. I am a lazy person and I really try to fight it and learn the things I need. I understood that once you understand the basics you have to divide your time about 50/50 between more advanced courses and starting to work on projects. Otherwise, you won't learn.
Since I want to be a CPA I think that data science knowledge will very help me in my career. There are the more advanced stuff like Python and R and the simple but still very important tools like sql and Excel. 
So the courses I have done so far are:
Python - https://www.udemy.com/course/the-modern-python3-bootcamp/ (a very good instructor, I'm considering taking his sql course).
intro to data science - https://www.udemy.com/course/datascience/
R course - https://www.udemy.com/course/r-programming/
Python for data science (currently doing) - https://www.udemy.com/course/python-coding/

Moreover, I've noticed that many successful people were somehow involved with Poker and I got curious about it and I'm currently doing this course - https://www.udemy.com/course/crush-online-micro-stakes-poker/ I'm only in the beginning and it's amazing how depth there is in a game that seems like it's only luck.","Udemy Affiliate Program

<@!316154052364992512> it varies a little bit because the corona and lockdown. I'm on my third year of BA in Accounting and Economics so I have to study and participate in scholarships activities. Then I have the gym and jiujitsu (now I workout at home because the gyms are closed), I used to watch Netflix but I stopped because I prefer to watch online courses on Udemy instead. Moreover I like to read books, I get bored easily from one book so I read several simultaneously and jump from one to another.  
As for the guitar, I have a Skype lesson once every two weeks and I aim to practice at least 4-5 days a week for at least an hour.  But I feel I waste lots of time on social media - watching lots of YouTube videos (even though I watch mostly self improvement videos but still..),  scrolling through Facebook and watching some nice films üòâ .

8506,"Ah, I got so busy I forgot to write up. Overall it is very good information. It does not spend any time on technique so it's probably not best for complete beginner in the absence of a teacher or another method of approaching the basics. There are several examples of comp√°s and then some falsettas for Solea, tango and buler√≠as.  This is then followed by a section on accompaniment that I still haven't read through yet.

8532,Yeah let's talk about it. I am 100% in favor of simplifying the channels so we can prevent too much segmentation,,,,suggestions
8533,"I know what it's supposed to be and I don't know how commands work. But if you have tips commands on the Learning channel, that show which tips you wanna see, it could be enough. No? I probably just get it wrong",,,,suggestions
8534,"Maybe we should rename learning to make it more clear. Like, ""work-in-progress""?",,,,suggestions
8535,Yeah they seem close enough to merge. I agree  <@380654265326370816>,,,,suggestions
8536,But these are local to the progress videos so I think it's okay to have some overlapping. The tips channel is more about general tips that you like to share,,,,suggestions
8537,"The learning channel was originally created for sharing your progress. Like hey, this is what I'm working on what do you think? But of course that will eventually prompt questions about technique, tip, etc",,,,suggestions
8538,"I was just wondering whether we could use those commands to show tips as well instead of having both a learning and a tips channel. Tips is kinda ""Learning mini"" without questions and without progress. But learning is full of tips in the other hand... Do I make any sense?",,,,suggestions
8539,That's all very technical for me..,,,,suggestions
8540,Let's figure out a time we can do this because I'd want to be paying attention when you are testing the bot should anything go wrong.,,,,suggestions

8542,"> We can have the folders be more fine grain than just the channels. Maybe you want files relating to solea, or piccado.
<@!102376572891193344> Yeah for sure I like the idea of better organization via the program. But it would be cool to keep the contextual reference in tact (i.e. originating channel) to make it easy to reference backwards should anyone want to explore the relevant discussions that happened.",,,,suggestions
8543,"<@380654265326370816> As for not privileges, the bot doesn‚Äôt need admin, but I believe that only admins can invite bots to servers. I tried to invite it, but was only able to invite it to servers I own.",,,,suggestions
8544,Any type of gradation or partitioning we want can be done. We just need to decide on what we want,,,,suggestions
8545,"We can have the folders be more fine grain than just the channels. Maybe you want files relating to solea, or piccado.",,,,suggestions
8546,"Maybe the categories can be extracted from the channel names like ""learning, techniques, general, etc."". I agree with <@!316154052364992512> Ibuken, the channels aren't perfect, definitely room for improvement. Can you share what your ideal list of channels would look like?",,,,suggestions
8547,"I don't understand why admin privilege is needed for the bot to work <@!102376572891193344> . Admin privileges = kick, ban, create, remove channels, delete messages, etc. The bot doesn't need to do any of that. Scanning each message is accessible by all members so the bot shouldn't have problems with accessing past messages either. For these reasons, I have to say no to the granting of admin privileges to the bot.",,,,suggestions
8548,"So, we would need to deiced on what these catagories should be, rather having C1, C2, ..., Cn, which dont actually mean anything.",,,,suggestions
8549,"<@!554385137702404106> <@!316154052364992512> <@!380654265326370816> To test the bot in here, I think I need admin privileges (it is restricted to only read operations). Also, we should talk about what exactly we want the bot to do. Currently, it will save all links/files that have ever been posted in chat channels. It then searches for the title of the file/link, or takes its best guess when it cant find one. Lastly, it labels each file/link as being in some category (for now lets just say categories are C1, C2, C3, ..., Cn), and saves each labeled file /link to the respective folder (where the folders are markdown files and each file/link has a title and a hyper link).",,,,suggestions
8550,"I get you, but then we should use it differently and not, like now, like it were the same. On the other hand less channels is less confusing. Thx for your input.",,,,suggestions
8551,"the music and video was supposed to be Seperate i.e videos for interviews and so on, and falseta and learning can be merged. I think videos and music can be merged too but I'd like a second opinion",,,,suggestions
8552,"also ""falseta"" and ""learning"" are used in a similar way",,,,suggestions
8553,"can we reduce the amount of channels? I don't see why we can't merge ""music"" and ""video",,,,suggestions
8554,For sure. We'll use this space to brainstorm and submit whatever ideas we have. You got some serious coding chops! That's a lot of progress for one day,,,,suggestions
8555,lol,,,,suggestions

8559,lol,,,,suggestions
8560,"There are no write operations, but maybe I should just run it on the test server untill its more ready, just in case.",,,,suggestions
8561,"Yeah if it's just a read-only operation, feel free try it out. But if there's any chance it can write to the channel like posting, I'd say hold off for now since that can potentially lead to unintended spamming and disrupt the channel.",,,,suggestions
8562,"Would it be ok to test the bot here? It wont to anything to the discord, it only reads the channels and saves info to text files.",,,,suggestions
8563,Nice!,,,,suggestions
8564,"Link can go into multiple folders, so we could have 1 folder for each channel that just saves all links and and files form that channel, as well as folders for more fine grain catagorizaiton",,,,suggestions
8565,"The only thing left to add is better filtering, right now it can only pick out solea and bularia videos.",,,,suggestions
8566,"If you check out the repo, im still messing around with the title representation, but its funcationally working",,,,suggestions
8567,"Ok, It now has a way to search the url and files for their names.",,,,suggestions
8568,This is really cool. It would be nice to extract out the titles from youtube links so it's easier to see on first glance but maybe that come later once you have it working the way you like it,,,,suggestions
8569,"Navigate to the desired folder, click the link, the browser will either open the link, or download the file the link points to",,,,suggestions

Then you Can add rasgueados. In my opinion it's the base of the base, you can't start flamenco learning alzapua for exemple.
